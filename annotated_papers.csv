CONNECTIVITY VERSUS ENTROPY,"How does the connectivity of a neural network (number of synapses per neuron) relate to the complexity of the problems it can handle (measured by the entropy)? Switching theory would suggest no relation at all, since all Boolean functions can be implemented using a circuit with very low connectivity (e.g., using two-input NAND gates). However, for a network that learns a problem from examples using a local learning rule, we prove that the entropy of the problem becomes a lower bound for the connectivity of the network. INTRODUCTION The most distinguishing feature of neural networks is their ability to spon taneously learn the desired function from 'training' samples, i.e., their ability to program themselves. Clearly, a given neural network cannot just learn any function, there must be some restrictions on which networks can learn which functions. One obvious restriction, which is independent of the learning aspect, is that the network must be big enough to accommodate the circuit comp",Optimization & Theoretical ML,03afdbd66e7929b125f8597834fa83a4-Paper.pdf,1987
BIT - SERIAL NEURAL NETWORKS,"A bit - serial VLSI neural network is described from an initial architecture for a synapse array through to silicon layout and board design. The issues surrounding bit - serial computation, and analog/digital arithmetic are discussed and the parallel development of a hybrid analog/digital neural network is outlined. Learning and recall capabilities are reported for the bit - serial network along with a projected specification for a 64 - neuron, bit - serial board operating at 20 MHz. This tech nique is extended to a 256 (2562 synapses) network with an update time of 3ms, using a ""paging"" technique to time - multiplex calculations through the synapse array.",Computer Vision,02e74f10e0327ad868d138f2b4fdd6f0-Paper.pdf,1987
THE HOPFIELD MODEL WITH MULT I-LEVEL NEURONS,"The Hopfield neural network. model for associative memory is generalized. The generalization replaces two state neurons by neurons taking a richer set of values. Two classes of neuron input output relations are developed guaranteeing convergence to stable states. The first is a class of ""continuous"" rela- tions and the second is a class of allowed quantization rules for the neurons. The information capacity for networks from the second class is fOWld to be of order N 3 bits for a network with N neurons. A generalization of the sum of outer products learning rule is developed and investigated as well. Â© American Institute of Physics 1988 279 I. INTRODUCTION The ability to perfonn collective computation in a distributed system of flexible structure without global synchronization is an important engineering objective. Hopfield's neural network [1] is such a model of associative content addressable memory. An important property of the Hopfield neural network is its guaranteed convergence t",Optimization & Theoretical ML,072b030ba126b2f4b2374f342be9ed44-Paper.pdf,1987
How Neural Nets Work,"There is presently great interest in the abilities of neural networks to mimic ""qualitative reasoning"" by manipulating neural incodings of symbols. Less work has been performed on using neural networks to process floating point numbers and it is sometimes stated that neural networks are somehow inherently inaccu rate and therefore best suited for ""fuzzy"" qualitative reasoning. Nevertheless, the potential speed of massively parallel operations make neural net ""number crunching"" an interesting topic to explore. In this paper we discuss some of our work in which we demonstrate that for certain applications neural networks can achieve significantly higher numerical accuracy than more conventional tech niques. In particular, prediction of future values of a chaotic time series can be performed with exceptionally high accuracy. We analyze how a neural net is able to do this , and in the process show that a large class of functions from Rn. ~ Rffl may be accurately approximated by a backpropa",Deep Learning,093f65e080a295f8076b1c5722a46aa2-Paper.pdf,1987
SPATIAL ORGANIZATION OF NEURAL,"The aim of this paper is to explore the spatial organization of neural networks under Markovian assumptions, in what concerns the be haviour of individual cells and the interconnection mechanism. Space organizational properties of neural nets are very relevant in image modeling and pattern analysis, where spatial computations on stocha stic two-dimensional image fields are involved. As a first approach we develop a random neural network model, based upon simple probabi listic assumptions, whose organization is studied by means of dis crete-event simulation. We then investigate the possibility of ap proXimating the random network's behaviour by using an analytical ap proach originating from the theory of general product-form queueing networks. The neural network is described by an open network of no des, in which customers moving from node to node represent stimula tions and connections between nodes are expressed in terms of sui tably selected routing probabilities. We obtain the solut",Reinforcement Learning,14bfa6bb14875e45bba028a21ed38046-Paper.pdf,1987
A NEURAL-NETWORK SOLUTION TO THE CONCENTRATOR,"Networks of simple analog processors having neuron-like properties have been employed to compute good solutions to a variety of optimization prob lems. This paper presents a neural-net solution to a resource allocation prob lem that arises in providing local access to the backbone of a wide-area com munication network. The problem is described in terms of an energy function that can be mapped onto an analog computational network. Simulation results characterizing the performance of the neural computation are also presented. INTRODUCTION This paper presents a neural-network solution to a resource allocation problem that arises in providing access to the backbone of a communication network. 1 In the field of operations research, this problem was first known as the warehouse location problem and heuristics for finding feasible, suboptimal solutions have been developed previously.2.

LEARNING BY ST ATE RECURRENCE DETECfION,"This research investigates a new technique for unsupervised learning of nonlinear control problems. The approach is applied both to Michie and Chambers BOXES algorithm and to Barto, Sutton and Anderson's extension, the ASE/ACE system, and has significantly improved the convergence rate of stochastically based learning automata. Recurrence learning is a new nonlinear reward-penalty algorithm. It exploits information found during learning trials to reinforce decisions resulting in the recurrence of nonfailing states. Recurrence learning applies positive reinforcement during the exploration of the search space, whereas in the BOXES or ASE algorithms, only negative weight reinforcement is applied, and then only on failure. Simulation results show that the added information from recurrence learning increases the learning rate. Our empirical results show that recurrence learning is faster than both basic failure driven learning and failure prediction methods. Although recurrence learning has",Reinforcement Learning,182be0c5cdcd5072bb1864cdee4d3d6e-Paper.pdf,1987
STABILITY RESULTS FOR NEURAL NETWORKS,"In the present paper we survey and utilize results from the qualitative theory of large scale interconnected dynamical systems in order to develop a qualitative theory for the Hopfield model of neural networks. In our approach we view such networks as an inter connection of many single neurons. Our results are phrased in terms of the qualitative properties of the individual neurons and in terms of the properties of the interconnecting structure of the neural networks. Aspects of neural networks which we address include asymptotic stability, exponential stability, and instability of an equilibrium; estimates of trajectory bounds; estimates of the domain of attraction of an asymptotically stable equilibrium; and stability of neural networks under structural perturbations.

INTRODUCTION TO A SYSTEM FOR IMPLEMENTING NEURAL NET,"Neural networks have attracted much interest recently, and using parallel architectures to simulate neural networks is a natural and necessary applica tion. The SIMD model of parallel computation is chosen, because systems of this type can be built with large numbers of processing elements. However, such systems are not naturally suited to generalized communication. A method is proposed that allows an implementation of neural network connections on massively parallel SIMD architectures. The key to this system is an algorithm that allows the formation of arbitrary connections between the ""neurons"". A feature is the ability to add new connections quickly. It also has error recov ery ability and is robust over a variety of network topologies. Simulations of the general connection system, and its implementation on the Connection Ma chine, indicate that the time and space requirements are proportional to the product of the average number of connections per neuron and the diameter of the int",Deep Learning,1c383cd30b7c298ab50293adfecb7b18-Paper.pdf,1987
OPTIMIZAn ON WITH ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK SYSTEMS:,General formulae for mapping optimization problems into systems of ordinary differential equations associated with artificial neural networks are presented. A comparison is made to optim ization using gradient-search methods. The perfonnance measure is the settling time from an initial state to a target state. A simple analytical example illustrates a situation where dynamical systems representing artificial neural network methods would settle faster than those representing gradient search. Settling time was investigated for a more complicated optimization problem using com puter simulations. The problem was a simplified version of a problem in medical imaging: deter mining loci of cerebral activity from electromagnetic measurements at the scalp. The simulations showed that gradient based systems typically settled 50 to 100 times faster than systems based on current neural network optimization methods.

OPTIMAL NEURAL SPIKE CLASSIFICATION,"Being able to record the electrical activities of a number of neurons simultaneously is likely to be important in the study of the functional organization of networks of real neurons. Using one extracellular microelectrode to record from several neurons is one approach to studying the response properties of sets of adjacent and therefore likely related neurons. However, to do this, it is necessary to correctly classify the signals generated by these different neurons. This paper considers this problem of classifying the signals in such an extracellular recording, based upon their shapes, and specifically considers the classification of signals in the case when spikes overlap temporally. Introduction How single neurons in a network of neurons interact when processing information is likely to be a fundamental question central to understanding how real neural networks compute. In the mammalian nervous system we know that spatially adjacent neurons are, in general, more likely to interact,",Optimization & Theoretical ML,1ff1de774005f8da13f42943881c655f-Paper.pdf,1987
REFLEXIVE ASSOCIATIVE MEMORIES,"In the synchronous discrete model, the average memory capacity of bidirectional associative memories (BAMs) is compared with that of Hopfield memories, by means of a calculat10n of the percentage of good recall for 100 random BAMs of dimension 64x64, for different numbers of stored vectors. The memory capac1ty Is found to be much smal1er than the Kosko upper bound, which Is the lesser of the two dimensions of the BAM. On the average, a 64x64 BAM has about 68 % of the capacity of the corresponding Hopfield memory with the same number of neurons. Ortho normal coding of the BAM Increases the effective storage capaCity by only 25 %. The memory capacity limitations are due to spurious stable states, which arise In BAMs In much the same way as in Hopfleld memories. Occurrence of spurious stable states can be avoided by replacing the thresholding in the backlayer of the BAM by another nonl1near process, here called ""Dominant Label Selection"" (DLS). The simplest DLS is the wlnner-take-all net,",Optimization & Theoretical ML,2838023a778dfaecdc212708f721b788-Paper.pdf,1987
The Performance of Convex Set projection Based Neural Networks,"We donsider a class of neural networks whose performance can be analyzed and geometrically visualized in a signal space environment. Alternating projection neural networks (APNN' s) perform by alternately projecting between two or more constraint sets. Criteria for desired and unique convergence are easily established. The network can be configured in either a homogeneous or layered form. The number of patterns that can be stored in the network is on the order of the number of input and hidden neurons. If the output neurons can take on only one of two states, then the trained layered APNN can be easily configured to converge in one iteration. More generally, convergence is at an exponential rate. Convergence can be improved by the use of sigmoid type nonlinearities, network relaxation and/or increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer. The manner in which the network responds to data for which it was not specifically trained (i.e. how it generalizes) can be directly evaluated ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,28dd2c7955ce926456240b2ff0100bde-Paper.pdf,1987
SPEECH RECOGNITION EXPERIMENTS,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are capable of accurate recognition of simple speech vocabularies such as isolated digits [1]. This paper looks at two more difficult vocabularies, the alphabetic E-set and a set of polysyllabic words. The E-set is difficult because it contains weak discriminants and polysyllables are difficult because of timing variation. Polysyllabic word recognition is aided by a time pre-alignment technique based on dynamic pro gramming and E-set recognition is improved by focusing attention. Recogni tion accuracies are better than 98% for both vocabularies when implemented with a single layer perceptron. INTRODUCTION Artificial neural networks perform well on simple pattern recognition tasks. On speaker trained spoken digits a layered network performs as accu rately as a conventional nearest neighbor classifier trained on the same tokens [1]. Spoken digits are easy to recognize since they are for the most part monosyllabic and are distinguished by strong vowels. I",NLP,2a38a4a9316c49e5a833517c45d31070-Paper.pdf,1987
ON PROPERTIES OF NETWORKS,"The complexity and computational capacity of multi-layered, feedforward neural networks is examined. Neural networks for special purpose (structured) functions are examined from the perspective of circuit complexity. Known re sults in complexity theory are applied to the special instance of neural network circuits, and in particular, classes of functions that can be implemented in shallow circuits characterised. Some conclusions are also drawn about learning complexity, and some open problems raised. The dual problem of determining the computational capacity of a class of multi-layered networks with dynamics regulated by an algebraic Hamiltonian is considered. Formal results are pre sented on the storage capacities of programmed higher-order structures, and a tradeoff between ease of programming and capacity is shown. A precise de termination is made of the static fixed point structure of random higher-order constructs, and phase-transitions (0-1 laws) are shown. 1 INTRODUCTION In this",Optimization & Theoretical ML,3295c76acbf4caaed33c36b1b5fc2cb1-Paper.pdf,1987

ON TROPISTIC PROCESSING AND ITS APPLICATIONS,"The interaction of a set of tropisms is sufficient in many cases to explain the seemingly complex behavioral responses exhibited by varied classes of biological systems to combinations of stimuli. It can be shown that a straightforward generalization of the tropism phenomenon allows the efficient implementation of effective algorithms which appear to respond ""intelligently"" to changing environmental conditions. Examples of the utilization of tropistic processing techniques will be presented in this paper in applications entailing simulated behavior synthesis, path-planning, pattern analysis (clustering), and engineering design optimization.

A 'Neural' Network that Learns to Play Backgammon,"We describe a class of connectionist networks that have learned to play back gammon at an intermediate-to-advanced level. TIle networks were trained by a supervised learning procedure on a large set of sample positions evaluated by a human expert. In actual match play against humans and conventional computer programs, the networks demonstrate substantial ability to generalize on the basis of expert knowledge. Our study touches on some of the most important issues in net work learning theory, including the development of efficient coding schemes and training procedures, scaling, generalization, the use of real-valued inputs and out puts, and techniques for escaping from local minima. Practical applications in games and other domains are also discussed.

LEARNING REPRESENTATIONS BY RECIRCULATION,"We describe a new learning procedure for networks that contain groups of non linear units arranged in a closed loop. The aim of the learning is to discover codes that allow the activity vectors in a ""visible"" group to be represented by activity vectors in a ""hidden"" group. One way to test whether a code is an accurate representation is to try to reconstruct the visible vector from the hidden vector. The difference between the original and the reconstructed visible vectors is called the reconstruction error, and the learning procedure aims to minimize this error. The learning procedure has two passes. On the fust pass, the original visible vector is passed around the loop, and on the second pass an average of the original vector and the reconstructed vector is passed around the loop. The learning procedure changes each weight by an amount proportional to the product of the ""presynaptic"" activity and the difference in the post-synaptic activity on the two passes. This procedure is much s",Deep Learning,35f4a8d465e6e1edc05f3d8ab658c551-Paper.pdf,1987

P A' ITERN CLASS DEGENERACY IN AN UNRESTRICfED STORAGE,"The study of distributed memory systems has produced a number of models which work well in limited domains. However, until recently, the application of such systems to real world problems has been difficult because of storage limitations, and their inherent architectural (and for serial simulation, computational) complexity. Recent development of memories with unrestricted storage capacity and economical feedforward architectures has opened the way to the application of such systems to complex pattern recognition problems. However, such problems are sometimes underspecified by the features which describe the environment, and thus a significant portion of the pattern environment is often non-separable. We will review current work on high density memory systems and their network implementations. We will discuss a general learning algorithm for such high density memories and review its application to separable point sets. Finally, we will introduce an extension of this method for learning",Computer Vision,3c59dc048e8850243be8079a5c74d079-Paper.pdf,1987
Strategies for Teaching Layered Networks,"There is a widespread misconception that the delta-rule is in some sense guaranteed to work on networks without hidden units. As previous authors have mentioned, there is no such guarantee for classification tasks. We will begin by presenting explicit counter examples illustrating two different interesting ways in which the delta rule can fail. We go on to provide conditions which do guarantee that gradient descent will successfully train networks without hidden units to perform two-category classification tasks. We discuss the generalization of our ideas to networks with hidden units and to multi category classification tasks. The Classification Task Consider networks of the form indicated in figure 1. We discuss various methods for training such a network, that is for adjusting its weight vector, w. If we call the input v, the output is g(wÂ· v), where 9 is some function. The classification task we wish to train the network to perform is the following. Given two finite sets of vectors",Optimization & Theoretical ML,3ef815416f775098fe977004015c6193-Paper.pdf,1987
Invariant Object Recognition Using a Distributed Associative Memory,"This paper describes an approach to 2-dimensional object recognition. Complex-log con formal mapping is combined with a distributed associative memory to create a system which recognizes objects regardless of changes in rotation or scale. Recalled information from the memorized database is used to classify an object, reconstruct the memorized ver sion of the object, and estimate the magnitude of changes in scale or rotation. The system response is resistant to moderate amounts of noise and occlusion. Several experiments, us ing real, gray scale images, are presented to show the feasibility of our approach. Introduction The challenge of the visual recognition problem stems from the fact that the projec tion of an object onto an image can be confounded by several dimensions of variability such as uncertain perspective, changing orientation and scale, sensor noise, occlusion, and non-uniform illumination. A vision system must not only be able to sense the identity of an object despite thi",Computer Vision,43ec517d68b6edd3015b3edc9a11367b-Paper.pdf,1987
CYCLES: A Simulation Tool for Studying,"A computer program has been designed and implemented to allow a researcher to analyze the oscillatory behavior of simulated neural networks with cyclic con nectivity. The computer program, implemented on the Texas Instruments Ex plorer / Odyssey system, and the results of numerous experiments are discussed. The program, CYCLES, allows a user to construct, operate, and inspect neural networks containing cyclic connection paths with the aid of a powerful graphics based interface. Numerous cycles have been studied, including cycles with one or more activation points, non-interruptible cycles, cycles with variable path lengths, and interacting cycles. The final class, interacting cycles, is important due to its ability to implement time-dependent goal processing in neural networks.

LEARNING ON A GENERAL NETWORK,"This paper generalizes the backpropagation method to a general network containing feed back t;onnections. The network model considered consists of interconnected groups of neurons, where each group could be fully interconnected (it could have feedback connections, with pos sibly asymmetric weights), but no loops between the groups are allowed. A stochastic descent algorithm is applied, under a certain inequality constraint on each intra-group weight matrix which ensures for the network to possess a unique equilibrium state for every input. Introduction It has been shown in the last few years that large networks of interconnected ""neuron"" -like elemp.nts are quite suitable for performing a variety of computational and pattern recognition tasks.

William Y. Huang and Richard P.

Here we demonstrate that two-layer perceptron classifiers trained with back propagation can form both convex and disjoint decision regions. Such classifiers are robust, train rapidly, and provide good performance with simple decision regions. When complex decision regions are required, however, convergence time can be excessively long and performance is often no better than that of k-nearest neighbor classifiers. Three neural net classifiers are presented that provide more rapid training under such situations. Two use fixed weights in the first one or two layers and are similar to classifiers that estimate probability density functions using histograms. A third ""feature map classifier"" uses both unsupervised and supervised training.

Scaling Properties of Coarse-Coded Symbol Memories,"symbol processing models. In order to determine how these models would scale, one must first have some understanding of the mathematics of coarse-coded representa tions.

SYNCHRONIZATION IN NEURAL NETS,"The paper presents an artificial neural network concept (the Synchronizable Oscillator Networks) where the instants of individual firings in the form of point processes constitute the only form of information transmitted between joining neurons. This type of communication contrasts with that which is assumed in most other models which typically are continuous or discrete value-passing networks. Limiting the messages received by each processing unit to time markers that signal the firing of other units presents significant implemen tation advantages. In our model, neurons fire spontaneously and regularly in the absence of perturbation. When interaction is present, the scheduled firings are advanced or delayed by the firing of neighboring neurons. Networks of such neurons become global oscillators which exhibit multiple synchronizing attractors. From arbitrary initial states, energy minimization learning procedures can make the network converge to oscillatory modes that satisfy multi-dim",Optimization & Theoretical ML,6364d3f0f495b6ab9dcf8d3b5c6e0b01-Paper.pdf,1987
A Neural Network Classifier Based on Coding Theory,"The new neural network classifier we propose transforms the classification problem into the coding theory problem of decoding a noisy codeword. An input vector in the feature space is transformed into an internal representation which is a codeword in the code space, and then error correction decoded in this space to classify the input feature vector to its class. Two classes of codes which give high performance are the Hadamard matrix code and the maximal length sequence code. We show that the number of classes stored in an N-neuron system is linear in N and significantly more than that obtainable by using the Hopfield type memory as a classifier. I.

Analysis of distributed representation of,"A general method, the tensor product representation, is described for the distributed representation of value/variable bindings. The method allows the fully distributed representation of symbolic structures: the roles in the structures, as well as the fillers for those roles, can be arbitrarily non-local. Fully and partially localized special cases reduce to existing cases of connectionist representations of structured data; the tensor product representation generalizes these and the few existing examples of fuUy distributed representations of structures. The representation saturates gracefully as larger structures are represented; it penn its recursive construction of complex representations from simpler ones; it respects the independence of the capacities to generate and maintain multiple bindings in parallel; it extends naturally to continuous structures and continuous representational patterns; it pennits values to also serve as variables; it enables analysis of the interference of",Deep Learning,66f041e16a60928b05a7e228a89c3799-Paper.pdf,1987

BASINS OF ATTRACTION FOR,"We have studied the basins of attraction for fixed point and oscillatory attractors in an electronic analog neural network. Basin measurement circuitry periodically opens the network feedback loop, loads raster-scanned initial conditions and examines the resulting attractor. Plotting the basins for fixed points (memories), we show that overloading an associative memory network leads to irregular basin shapes. The network also includes analog time delay circuitry, and we have shown that delay in symmetric networks can introduce basins for oscillatory attractors.

PROGRAMMABLE SYNAPTIC CHIP FOR,"A binary synaptic matrix chip has been developed for electronic neural networks. The matrix chip contains a programmable 32X32 array of ""long channel"" NMOSFET binary connection elements imple mented in a 3-um bulk CMOS process. Since the neurons are kept off chip, the synaptic chip serves as a ""cascadable"" building block for a multi-chip synaptic network as large as 512X512 in size. As an alternative to the programmable NMOSFET (long channel) connection elements, tailored thin film resistors are deposited, in series with FET switches, on some CMOS test chips, to obtain the weak synaptic connections. Although deposition and patterning of the resistors require additional processing steps, they promise substantial savings in silcon area. The performance of a synaptic chip in a 32- neuron breadboard system in an associative memory test application is discussed.

LEARNING A COLOR ALGORITHM FROM EXAMPLES,"A lightness algorithm that separates surface reflectance from illumination in a Mondrian world is synthesized automatically from a set of examples, pairs of input (image irradiance) and desired output (surface reflectance). The algorithm, which re sembles a new lightness algorithm recently proposed by Land, is approximately equiva lent to filtering the image through a center-surround receptive field in individual chro matic channels. The synthesizing technique, optimal linear estimation, requires only one assumption, that the operator that transforms input into output is linear. This assumption is true for a certain class of early vision algorithms that may therefore be synthesized in a similar way from examples. Other methods of synthesizing algorithms from examples, or ""learning"", such as backpropagation, do not yield a significantly dif ferent or better lightness algorithm in the Mondrian world.

GENERALIZATION OF BACKPROPAGATION,"A general method for deriving backpropagation algorithms for networks with recurrent and higher order networks is introduced. The propagation of activation in these networks is determined by dissipative differential equations. The error signal is backpropagated by integrating an associated differential equation. The method is introduced by applying it to the recurrent generalization of the feedforward backpropagation network. The method is extended to the case of higher order networks and to a constrained dynamical system for training a content addressable memory. The essential feature of the adaptive algorithms is that adaptive equation has a simple outer product form. Preliminary experiments suggest that learning can occur very rapidly in networks with recurrent connections. The continuous formalism makes the new approach more suitable for implementation in VLSI.

On the Power of Neural Networks for,"This paper deals with a neural network model in which each neuron performs a threshold logic function. An important property of the model is that it always converges to a stable state when operating in a serial mode [2,5]. This property is the basis of the potential applications of the model such as associative memory devices and combinatorial optimization [3,6]. One of the motivations for use of the model for solving hard combinatorial problems is the fact that it can be implemented by optical devices and thus operate at a higher speed than conventional electronics. The main theme in this work is to investigate the power of the model for solving NP-hard problems [4,8], and to understand the relation between speed of operation and the size of a neural network. In particular, it will be shown that for any NP-hard problem the existence of a polynomial size network that solves it implies that NP=co-NP.

In addition, the ""pipelined"" design of architecture illustrates how a goal-directed system effectively utilizes interactive feedback from its environment. Anatomical analysis of neural networks involved in target-tracking indicated that reticular neurons within the medullary region of the brainstem, mediate connections between the gustatory (sensory) inputs and the motor outputs of the spinal cord.

Real systems corresponding to such 'phasor' models can be e.g. (neuro)biological networks of limit-cycle oscillators or optical resonators that have a hologram in their feedback path. INTRODUCTION Most neural network models use either binary local variables or scalars combined with sigmoidal nonlinearities. Rather awkward coding schemes have to be invoked if one wants to maintain linear relations between the local signals being processed in e.g. associative memory networks, since the nonlinearities necessary for any nontrivial computation act directly on the range of values assumed by the local variables. In addition, there is the problem of representing signals that take values from a space with a different topology, e.g. that of the circle, sphere, torus, etc. Practical examples of such a signal",Computer Vision,8613985ec49eb8f757ae6439e879bb2a-Paper.pdf,1987

The high interconnectivity required by neural computers can be simply implemented in optics because channels for optical signals may be superimposed in three dimensions with little or no cross coupling. Since these channels may be formed holographically, optical neural systems can be designed to create and maintain interconnections very simply. Thus the optical system designer can to a large extent avoid the analytical and topological problems of determining individual interconnections for a given neural system and constructing physical paths for these interconnections.

MURPHY can use its internal model in the forward direction to ""envision"" sequences of actions for planning purposes, such as in grabbing a visually presented object, or in the reverse direction to ""imitate"", with its arm, autonomous activity in its visual field. Furthermore, by taking explicit advantage of continuity in the mappings between visual space and joint space, MURPHY is able to learn non-linear mappings with only a single layer of modifiable weights.

Correlational Strength and Computational Algebra,"Intracellular recordings in spinal cord motoneurons and cerebral cortex neurons have provided new evidence on the correlational strength of monosynaptic connections, and the relation between the shapes of postsynaptic potentials and the associated increased firing probability. In these cells, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) produce cross correlogram peaks which resemble in large part the derivative of the EPSP. Additional synaptic noise broadens the peak, but the peak area -- i.e., the number of above-chance firings triggered per EPSP -- remains proportional to the EPSP amplitude. A typical EPSP of 100 triggers about .01 firings per ~v EPSP. The consequences of these data for information processing by polysynaptic connections is discussed. The effects of sequential polysynaptic links can be calculated by convolving the effects of the underlying monosynaptic connections.

DISCOVERING STRUCfURE FROM MOTION IN,"The ability to obtain three-dimensional structure from visual motion is important for survival of human and non-human primates.

INTRODUcnON 1 Psychophysical experiments have shown that monke and man are equally adept at obtaining three dimensional structure from motion . In the present work, much effort has been expended mimicking the visual system. This was done for one main reason: the model was designed to help direct physiological experiments in the primate.

SCHEMA I'OR MOTOR CONTROL,"This paper outlines a schema for movement control based on two stages of signal processing. The higher stage is a neural network model that treats the cerebellum as an array of adjustable motor pattern generators. This network uses sensory input to preset and to trigger elemental pattern generators and to evaluate their performance. The actual patterned outputs, however, are produced by intrin sic circuitry that includes recurrent loops and is thus capable of self-sustained activity. These patterned outputs are sent as motor commands to local feedback systems called motor servos. The latter control the forces and lengths of individual muscles. Overall control is thus achieved in two stages: (1) an adaptive cerebellar network generates an array of feedforward motor commands and (2) a set of local feedback systems translates these commands into actual movements.

TIME-SEQUENTIAL SELF-ORGANIZATION OF HIERARCHICAL,"Self-organization of multi-layered networks can be realized by time-sequential organization of successive neural layers. Lateral inhibition operating in the surround of firing cells in each layer provides for unsupervised capture of excitation patterns presented by the previous layer. By presenting patterns of increasing complexity, in co-ordination with network self organization, higher levels of the hierarchy capture concepts implicit in the pattern set. INTRODUCTION A fundamental difficulty in self-organization of hierarchical, multi-layered, networks of simple neuron-like cells is the determination of the direction of adjustment of synaptic link weights between neural layers not directly connected to input or output patterns.

A serious problem of unwanted spontaneous oscillation often arises with these circuits and renders them unusable in practice. This paper reports a design approach that guarantees such a system will be stable, even though the values of designed elements and parasitic elements in the resistive grid may be unknown. The method is based on a rigorous, somewhat novel mathematical analysis using Tellegen's theorem and the idea of Popov multipliers from control theory. It is thoroughly practical because the criteria are local in the sense that no overall analysis of the interconnected system is required, empirical in the sense that they involve only measurable frequency response data on the individual cells, and robust in the sense that unmodelled parasitic resistances and capacitances in the inter connection network cannot af",Optimization & Theoretical ML,a684eceee76fc522773286a895bc8436-Paper.pdf,1987

Optimizations using energy methods yield ""forces"" which act upon the state of the neural network. The penalty method, in which quadratic energy constraints are added to an existing optimization energy, has become popular recently, but is not guaranteed to satisfy the constraint conditions when there are other forces on the neural model or when there are multiple constraints. In this paper, we present the basic differential multiplier method (BDMM), which satisfies constraints exactly; we create forces which gradually apply the constraints over time, using ""neurons"" that estimate Lagrange multipliers. The basic differential multiplier method is a differential version of the method of multipliers from Numerical Analysis.

ENCODING GEOMETRIC INVARIANCES IN,"We describe a method of constructing higher-order neural networks that respond invariantly under geometric transformations on the input space. By requiring each unit to satisfy a set of constraints on the interconnection weights, a particular structure is imposed on the network. A network built using such an architecture maintains its invariant performance independent of the values the weights assume, of the learning rules used, and of the form of the nonlinearities in the network. The invariance exhibited by a first order network is usually of a trivial sort, e.g., responding only to the average input in the case of translation invariance, whereas higher-order networks can perform useful functions and still exhibit the invariance.

A MEAN FIELD THEORY OF LAYER IV OF VISUAL CORTEX,"A single cell theory for the development of selectivity and ocular dominance in visual cortex has been presented previously by Bienenstock, Cooper and Munrol. This has been extended to a network applicable to layer IV of visual cortex2. In this paper we present a mean field approximation that captures in a fairly transparent manner the qualitative, and many of the quantitative, results of the network theory. Finally, we consider the application of this theory to artificial neural networks and show that a significant reduction in architectural complexity is possible. A SINGLE LAYER NETWORK AND THE MEAN FIELD APPROXIMATION We consider a single layer network of ideal neurons which receive signals from outside of the layer and from cells within the layer (Figure 1).

NEURAL NETWORKS FOR TEMPLATE MATCHING:,"Much experimental study of real neural networks relies on the proper classification of extracellulary sampled neural signals (i.e. action potentials) recorded from the brains of ex perimental animals. In most neurophysiology laboratories this classification task is simplified by limiting investigations to single, electrically well-isolated neurons recorded one at a time. However, for those interested in sampling the activities of many single neurons simultaneously, waveform classification becomes a serious concern. In this paper we describe and constrast three approaches to this problem each designed not only to recognize isolated neural events, but also to separately classify temporally overlapping events in real time. First we present two formulations of waveform classification using a neural network template matching approach. These two formulations are then compared to a simple template matching implementation. Analysis with real neural signals reveals that simple template matching",Deep Learning,d645920e395fedad7bbbed0eca3fe2e0-Paper.pdf,1987
CAPACITY FOR PATTERNS AND SEQUENCES IN KANERVA'S SDM,"The information capacity of Kanerva's Sparse, Distributed Memory (SDM) and Hopfield-type neural networks is investigated. Under the approximations used here, it is shown that the to tal information stored in these systems is proportional to the number connections in the net work. The proportionality constant is the same for the SDM and HopJreld-type models in dependent of the particular model, or the order of the model. The approximations are checked numerically. This same analysis can be used to show that the SDM can store se quences of spatiotemporal patterns, and the addition of time-delayed connections allows the retrieval of context dependent temporal patterns. A minor modification of the SDM can be used to store correlated patterns. INTRODUCTION Many different models of memory and thought have been proposed by scientists over the years.

The Connectivity Analysis of Simple Association,"The efficient realization, using current silicon technology, of Very Large Connection Networks (VLCN) with more than a billion connections requires that these networks exhibit a high degree of communication locality. Real neural networks exhibit significant locality, yet most connectionist/neural network models have little. In this paper, the connectivity requirements of a simple associative network are analyzed using communication theory. Several techniques based on communication theory are presented that improve the robust ness of the network in the face of sparse, local interconnect structures. Also discussed are some potential problems when information is distributed too widely.

Performance Measures for Associative Memories,"Recently, many modifications to the McCulloch/Pitts model have been proposed where both learning and forgetting occur. Given that the network never saturates (ceases to function effectively due to an overload of information), the learning updates can con tinue indefinitely. For these networks, we need to introduce performance measmes in addi tion to the information capacity to evaluate the different networks. We mathematically define quantities such as the plasticity of a network, the efficacy of an information vector, and the probability of network saturation. From these quantities we analytically compare different networks.",Optimization & Theoretical ML,d9d4f495e875a2e075a1a4a6e1b9770f-Paper.pdf,1987
Centric Models of the Orientation Map in Primary Visual Cortex,"In the visual cortex of the monkey the horizontal organization of the preferred orientations of orientation-selective cells follows two opposing rules: 1) neighbors tend to have similar orientation preferences, and 2) many different orientations are observed in a local region. Several orientation models which satisfy these constraints are found to differ in the spacing and the topological index of their singularities. Using the rate of orientation change as a measure, the models are compared to published experimental results. Introduction It has been known for some years that there exist orientation-sensitive neurons in the visual cortex of cats and mOnkeysl,2. These cells react to highly specific patterns of light occurring in narrowly circumscribed regiOns of the visual field, i.e., the cell's receptive field.

Using a simple Hebb-type learning rule in conjunc tion with the cortical dynamics which emerge from the anatomical and physiological organiza tion of the model, the simulations are capable of establishing cortical representations for differ ent input patterns. The basis of these representations lies in the interaction of sparsely distribut ed, highly divergent/convergent interconnections between modeled neurons.

TOWARDS AN ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE FOR,"An information-theoretic optimization principle is proposed for the development of each processing stage of a multilayered perceptual network. This principle of ""maximum information preservation"" states that the signal transformation that is to be realized at each stage is one that maximizes the information that the output signal values (from that stage) convey about the input signals values (to that stage), subject to certain constraints and in the presence of processing noise. The quantity being maximized is a Shannon information rate. I provide motivation for this principle and -- for some simple model cases -- derive some of its consequences, discuss an algorithmic implementation, and show how the principle may lead to biologically relevant neural architectural features such as topographic maps, map distortions, orientation selectivity, and extraction of spatial and temporal signal correlations.

A DYNAMICAL APPROACH TO TEMPORAL PATTERN,"Recognizing patterns with temporal context is important for such tasks as speech recognition, motion detection and signature verification. We propose an architecture in which time serves as its own representation, and temporal context is encoded in the state of the nodes. We contrast this with the approach of replicating portions of the architecture to represent time. As one example of these ideas, we demonstrate an architecture with capacitive inputs serving as temporal feature detectors in an otherwise standard back propagation model. Experiments involving motion detection and word discrimination serve to illustrate novel features of the system. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of the architecture.

ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT LEARNING,"We investigate the behavior of different learning algorithms for networks of neuron-like units. As test cases we use simple pat tern association problems, such as the XOR-problem and symmetry de tection problems. The algorithms considered are either versions of the Boltzmann machine learning rule or based on the backpropagation of errors. We also propose and analyze a generalized delta rule for linear threshold units. We find that the performance of a given learning algorithm depends strongly on the type of units used. In particular, we observe that networks with Â±1 units quite generally exhibit a significantly better learning behavior than the correspon ding 0,1 versions. We also demonstrate that an adaption of the weight-structure to the symmetries of the problem can lead to a drastic increase in learning speed.

Considering this system from the point of view of statistical estimation theory, our results sug gest that the transfer function of the VOR, often regarded as a static or slowly modifiable feature of the system, should actually be continu ously and rapidly changed during head movements.

Analysis and simulations show that a group of coupled non-linear oscillators are responsible for the oscillatory activities determined by the odor in put, and that the bulb, with appropriate inputs from higher centers, can enhance or suppress the sensitivity to partiCUlar odors.

THE BOLTZMANN PERCEPTRON NETWORK:,"The concept of the stochastic Boltzmann machine (BM) is auractive for decision making and pattern classification purposes since the probability of attaining the network states is a function of the network energy. Hence, the probability of attaining particular energy minima may be associated with the probabilities of making certain decisions (or classifications). However, because of its stochastic nature, the complexity of the BM is fairly high and therefore such networks are not very likely to be used in practice. In this paper we suggest a way to alleviate this drawback by converting the sto chastic BM into a deterministic network which we call the Boltzmann Per ceptron Network (BPN). The BPN is functionally equivalent to the BM but has a feed-forward structure and low complexity. No annealing is required. The conditions under which such a convmion is feasible are given.

This heterogeneity is crucial to the flexible generation of behavior which is essential for survival in a complex, dynamic environment. It may also provide powerful insights into the design of artificial neural networks. In this paper, we describe a heterogeneous neural network for controlling the wa1king of a simulated insect. This controller is inspired by the neuroethological and neurobiological literature on insect locomotion. It exhibits a variety of statically stable gaits at different speeds simply by varying the tonic activity of a single cell. It can also adapt to perturbations as a natural consequence of its design.

PROGRAMMABLE ANALOG PULSE-FIRING,"We describe pulse - stream firing integrated circuits that imple ment asynchronous analog neural networks. Synaptic weights are stored dynamically, and weighting uses time-division of the neural pulses from a signalling neuron to a receiving neuron. MOS transistors in their ""ON"" state act as variable resistors to control a capacitive discharge, and time-division is thus achieved by a small synapse circuit cell. The VLSI chip set design uses 2.5J.1.m CMOS technology. INTRODUCTION Neural network implementations fall into two broad classes - digital [1,2] and analog (e.g. [3,4]). The strengths of a digital approach include the ability to use well-proven design techniques, high noise immunity, and the ability to implement programmable networks.

In addition, this chip can provide Gaussian-like smoothing of images. INTRODUCTION Reconstructing a surface from sparse sensory data is a well-known problem in computer vision. Early vision modules typically supply sparse depth, orientation, and discontinuity information.

TRAINING MULTILAYER PERCEPTRONS WITH THE,"A large fraction of recent work in artificial neural nets uses multilayer perceptrons trained with the back-propagation algorithm described by Rumelhart et. a1. This algorithm converges slowly for large or complex problems such as speech recognition, where thousands of iterations may be needed for convergence even with small data sets. In this paper, we show that training multilayer perceptrons is an identification problem for a nonlinear dynamic system which can be solved using the Extended Kalman Algorithm. Although computationally complex, the Kalman algorithm usually converges in a few iterations. We describe the algorithm and compare it with back-propagation using two dimensional examples. INTRODUCTION Multilayer perceptrons are one of the most popular artificial neural net structures being used today.

AN ELECTRONIC PHOTORECEPTOR,"We describe an electronic photoreceptor circuit that is sensitive to small changes in incident light intensity. The sensitivity to change8 in the intensity is achieved by feeding back to the input a filtered version of the output. The feedback loop includes a hysteretic el ement. The circuit behaves in a manner reminiscent of the gain control properties and temporal responses of a variety of retinal cells, particularly retinal bipolar cells. We compare the thresholds for detection of intensity increments by a human and by the cir cuit. Both obey Weber's law and for both the temporal contrast sensitivities are nearly identical. We previously described an electronic photoreceptor that outputs a voltage that is logarithmic in the light intensity (Mead, 1985).

We show that it is NP-complete to decide whether there exist weights and thresholds for the three nodes of this network so that it will produce output con sistent with a given set of training examples. We extend the result to other simple networks. This result suggests that those looking for perfect training algorithms cannot escape inherent computational difficulties just by considering only simple or very regular networks. It also suggests the importance, given a training problem, of finding an appropriate network and input encoding for that problem.

AUTOMATIC LOCAL ANNEALING,This research involves a method for finding global maxima in constraint satisfaction networks. It is an annealing process butt unlike most otherst requires no annealing schedule. Temperature is instead determined locally by units at each updatet and thus all processing is done at the unit level. There are two major practical benefits to processing this way: 1) processing can continue in 'bad t areas of the networkt while 'good t areas remain stablet and 2) processing continues in the 'bad t areast as long as the constraints remain poorly satisfied (i.e. it does not stop after some predetermined number of cycles). As a resultt this method not only avoids the kludge of requiring an externally determined annealing schedulet but it also finds global maxima more quickly and consistently than externally scheduled systems (a comparison to the Boltzmann machine (Ackley et alt 1985) is made).

ADAPTIVE NEURAL NET PREPROCESSING,"A nonlinearity is required before matched filtering in mInimum error receivers when additive noise is present which is impulsive and highly non-Gaussian. Experiments were performed to determine whether the correct clipping nonlinearity could be provided by a single-input single output multi-layer perceptron trained with back propagation. It was found that a multi-layer perceptron with one input and output node, 20 nodes in the first hidden layer, and 5 nodes in the second hidden layer could be trained to provide a clipping nonlinearity with fewer than 5,000 presentations of noiseless and corrupted waveform samples. A network trained at a relatively high signal-to-noise (SIN) ratio and then used as a front end for a linear matched filter detector greatly reduced the probability of error.

A multilayer feedforward network model similar to Linsker's model was presented with input patterns each consisting of randomly oriented contours moving in a particular direction. Input layer units are granted component direction and speed tuning curves similar to those recorded from neurons in primate visual area VI that project to area MT. The network is trained on many such patterns until most weights saturate.

Adaptive Neural Networks Using MOS Charge Storage,"MOS charge storage has been demonstrated as an effective method to store the weights in VLSI implementations of neural network models by several workers 2. However, to achieve the full power of a VLSI implementation of an adaptive algorithm, the learning operation must built into the circuit.

We present a stability criterion based on local stability analysis to prevent sustained oscillation in symmetric delay networks, and show an example of chaotic dynamics in a non-symmetric delay network.

As we will show, it is not obvious what constitutes a ""small"" (i.e. ignorable) delay which will not qualitatively change the network dynamics.

But the first step in using color for recog nition, segmenting the scene into regions of different colors, does not require color constancy. In this crucial step color serves simply as a means of distinguishing one object from another in a given scene.

NEURAL NET RECEIVERS IN,"The application of neural networks to the demodulation of spread-spectrum signals in a multiple-access environment is considered. This study is motivated in large part by the fact that, in a multiuser system, the conventional (matched fil ter) receiver suffers severe performance degradation as the relative powers of the interfering signals become large (the ""near-far"" problem). Furthermore, the optimum receiver, which alleviates the near-far problem, is too complex to be of practical use. Receivers based on multi-layer perceptrons are considered as a simple and robust alternative to the opti mum solution. The optimum receiver is used to benchmark the performance of the neural net receiver; in particular, it is proven to be instrumental in identifying the decision regions of the neural networks. The back-propagation algorithm and a modified version of it are used to train the neural net.

A COMPUTATIONA.LLY ROBUST,"We analyze a mathematical model for retinal directionally selective cells based on recent electrophysiological data, and show that its computation of motion direction is robust against noise and speed. INTROduCTION Directionally selective retinal ganglion cells discriminate direction of visual motion relatively independently of speed (Amthor and Grzywacz, 1988a) and with high contrast sensitivity (Grzywacz, Amthor, and Mistler, 1989). These cells respond well to motion in the ""preferred"" direction, but respond poorly to motion in the opposite, null, direction. There is an increasing amount of experimental work devoted to these cells. Three findings are particularly relevant for this paper: 1- An inhibitory process asymmetric to every point of the receptive field underlies the directional selectivity of ON-OFF ganglion cells of the rabbit retina (Barlow and Levick, 1965).

NEURAL NETWORK STAR PATTERN,"Currently, the most complex spacecraft attitude determination and control tasks are ultimately governed by ground-based systems and personnel. Conventional on-board systems face severe computational bottlenecks introduced by serial microprocessors operating on inherently parallel problems.

This paper discusses the latest applications of artificial neural networks to the problem of star pattern recognition for spacecraft attitude determination. INTRODUCTION By design, a conventional on-board microprocessor can perform only one comparison or calculation at a time.

STATISTICAL PREDICTION WITH KANERVA'S,"A new viewpoint of the processing performed by Kanerva's sparse distributed memory (SDM) is presented. In conditions of near- or over- capacity, where the associative-memory behavior of the mod el breaks down, the processing performed by the model can be inter preted as that of a statistical predictor. Mathematical results are presented which serve as the framework for a new statistical view point of sparse distributed memory and for which the standard for mulation of SDM is a special case. This viewpoint suggests possi ble enhancements to the SDM model, including a procedure for improving the predictiveness of the system based on Holland's work with 'Genetic Algorithms', and a method for improving the capacity of SDM even when used as an associative memory.

LEARNING SEQUENTIAL STRUCTURE,"We explore a network architecture introduced by Elman (1988) for predicting successive elements of a sequence. The network uses the pattern of activation over a set of hidden units from time-step t-l, together with element t, to predict element t+ 1. When the network is trained with strings from a particular finite-state grammar, it can learn to be a perfect finite-state recognizer for the grammar. Cluster analyses of the hidden-layer patterns of activation showed that they encode prediction-relevant information about the entire path traversed through the network. We illustrate the phases of learning with cluster analyses performed at different points during training. Several connectionist architectures that are explicitly constrained to capture sequential infonnation have been developed.

The algorithm can automati cally find optimal or nearly optimal architectures necessary to solve known Boolean functions, facilitate the interpretation of the activation of the remaining hidden units and automatically estimate the complexity of architectures appropriate for phonetic labeling problems. The general principle of the algorithm can also be adapted to different tasks: for example, it can be used to eliminate the [0, 0] local minimum of the [-1. +1] logistic acti vation function while preserving a much faster convergence and forcing binary activations over the set of hidden units.

Procedures like back-propagation (Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams, 1986) which compute how changes in activities af fect the output error are much more efficient, but require more complex hardware. GEMINI is a hybrid procedure for multilayer networks, which shares many of the implementation advantages of correlational reinforce ment procedures but is more efficient. GEMINI injects noise only at the first hidden layer and measures the resultant effect on the output error. A linear network associated with each hidden layer iteratively inverts the matrix which relates the noise to the error change, thereby obtaining the error-derivatives. No back-propagation is involved, thus allowing un known non-linearities in the system. Two simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMINI.

Such formulations are parsimonious, being expressible in several lines of algebra, and may be converted into artificial neural networks which perform the optimization.

PERFORMANCE OF SYNTHETIC NEURAL,"This study evaluates the performance of the multilayer-perceptron and the frequency-sensitive competitive learning network in iden tifying five commercial aircraft from radar backscatter measure ments. The performance of the neural network classifiers is com pared with that of the nearest-neighbor and maximum-likelihood classifiers.

These analog, continuous-time circuits use only O(n) of interconnect to perform this function. We have also modified the winner-take-all circuit, realizing a circuit that computes local nonlinear inhibition. Two general types of inhibition mediate activity in neural systems: subtractive in hibition, which sets a zero level for the computation, and multiplicative (nonlinear) inhibition, which regulates the gain of the computation.

We show how to exploit the machine's ability to escape local minima, in order to use it, at a constant temperature, for unambiguous associative pattern-retrieval in noisy environments. An association rule, which creates a sphere of influence around each stored pattern, is used along with the Machine's dynamics to match the machine's noisy input with one of the pre-stored patterns. Spurious fIxed points, whose regions of attraction are not recognized by the rule, are skipped, due to the Machine's fInite probability to escape from any state.

"DYNAMIC, NONÂ·LOCAL ROLE BINDINGS AND","This paper introduces a means to handle the critical problem of non local role-bindings in localist spreading-activation networks. Every conceptual node in the network broadcasts a stable, uniquely-identifying activation pattern, called its signature. A dynamic role-binding is cre ated when a role's binding node has an activation that matches the bound concept's signature. Most importantly, signatures are propagated across long paths of nodes to handle the non-local role-bindings neces sary for inferencing. Our localist network model, ROBIN (ROle Binding and Inferencing Network), uses signature activations to ro bustly represent schemata role-bindings and thus perfonn the inferenc ing, plan/goal analysis, schema instantiation, word-sense disambigua tion, and dynamic re-interpretation portions of the natural language un derstanding process.

STORING COVARIANCE BY THE ASSOCIATIVE,"In modeling studies or memory based on neural networks, both the selective or enhancement and depression synaptic strengths are required ror effident storage or inrormation (Sejnowski, 1977a,b; Kohonen, 1984; Bienenstock et aI, 1982; Sejnowski and Tesauro, 1989). We have tested this assumption in the hippocampus, a cortical structure or the brain that is involved in long-term memory. A brier, high-frequency activation or excitatory synapses in the hippocampus produces an increase in synaptic strength known as long-term potentiation, or L TP (BUss and Lomo, 1973), that can last ror many days. LTP is known to be Hebbian since it requires the simultaneous release or neurotransmitter from presynaptic terminals coupled with postsynaptic depolarization (Kelso et al, 1986; Malinow and Miller, 1986; Gustatrson et al, 1987). However, a mechanism ror the persistent reduction or synaptic strength that could balance LTP has not yet been demonstrated.

FIXED POINT ANALYSIS FOR RECURRENT,"This paper provides a systematic analysis of the recurrent backpropaga tion (RBP) algorithm, introducing a number of new results. The main limitation of the RBP algorithm is that it assumes the convergence of the network to a stable fixed point in order to backpropagate the error signals. We show by experiment and eigenvalue analysis that this condi tion can be violated and that chaotic behavior can be avoided. Next we examine the advantages of RBP over the standard backpropagation al gorithm. RBP is shown to build stable fixed points corresponding to the input patterns. This makes it an appropriate tool for content address able memories, one-to-many function learning, and inverse problems.

A nalog Circuits for Constrained Optimization,"This paper explores whether analog circuitry can adequately per form constrained optimization. Constrained optimization circuits are designed using the differential multiplier method. These cir cuits fulfill time-varying constraints correctly. Example circuits in clude a quadratic programming circuit and a constrained flip-flop. 1 INTRODUCTION Converting perceptual and cognitive tasks into constrained optimization problems is a useful way of generating neural networks to solve those tasks. Researchers have used constrained optimization networks to solve the traveling salesman problem [Durbin, 1987] [Hopfield, 1985], to perform object recognition [Gindi, 1988], and to decode error-correcting codes [Platt, 1986].

Training Stochastic Model Recognition,"One of the attractions of neural network approaches to pattern recognition is the use of a discrimination-based training method. We show that once we have modified the output layer of a multi layer perceptron to provide mathematically correct probability dis tributions, and replaced the usual squared error criterion with a probability-based score, the result is equivalent to Maximum Mu tual Information training, which has been used successfully to im prove the performance of hidden Markov models for speech recog nition. If the network is specially constructed to perform the recog nition computations of a given kind of stochastic model based clas sifier then we obtain a method for discrimination-based training of the parameters of the models.

Can Simple Cells Learn Curves? A,"In the mammalian visual cortex, orientation-selective 'simple cells' which detect straight lines may be adapted to detect curved lines instead. We test a biologically plausible, Hebbian, single-neuron model, which learns oriented receptive fields upon exposure to un structured (noise) input and maintains orientation selectivity upon exposure to edges or bars of all orientations and positions. This model can also learn arc-shaped receptive fields upon exposure to an environment of only circular rings. Thus, new experiments which try to induce an abnormal (curved) receptive field may pro vide insight into the plasticity of simple cells. The model suggests that exposing cells to only a single spatial frequency may induce more striking spatial frequency and orientation dependent effects than heretofore observed. 1 Introduction Although most mathematical theories of cortical function assume plasticity of indi vidual cells, there is a strong debate in the biological community between ""instru",Computer Vision,03c6b06952c750899bb03d998e631860-Paper.pdf,1989

Predicting Weather Using a Genetic Memory: a Combi,"Kanerva's sparse distributed memory (SDM) is an associative-memo ry model based on the mathematical properties of high-dimensional binary address spaces. Holland's genetic algorithms are a search tech nique for high-dimensional spaces inspired by evolutionary processes of DNA. ""Genetic Memory"" is a hybrid of the above two systems, in which the memory uses a genetic algorithm to dynamically recon figure its physical storage locations to reflect correlations between the stored addresses and data. For example, when presented with raw weather station data, the Genetic Memory discovers specific fea tures in the weather data which correlate well with upcoming rain, and reconfigures the memory to utilize this information effectively. This architecture is designed to maximize the ability of the system to scale-up to handle real-world problems.

Neu.Â·al Network Analysis of,"Interneurons in leech ganglia receive multiple sensory inputs and make synaptic contacts with many motor neurons. These ""hidden"" units coordinate several different behaviors. We used physiological and anatomical constraints to construct a model of the local bending reflex. Dynamical networks were trained on experimentally derived input-output patterns using recurrent back-propagation. Units in the model were modified to include electrical synapses and multiple synaptic time constants. The properties of the hidden units that emerged in the simulations matched those in the leech. The model and data support distributed rather than localist representations in the local bending reflex. These results also explain counterintuitive aspects of the local bending circuitry.

A computer modeling approach to understanding the,"This paper presents the results of a simulation of the spatial relationship between the inferior olivary nucleus and folium crus IIA of the lateral hemisphere of the rat cerebellum. The principal objective of this modeling effort was to resolve an apparent conflict between a proposed zonal organization of olivary projections to cerebellar cortex suggested by anatomical tract-tracing experiments (Brodal & Kawamura 1980; Campbell & Armstrong 1983) and a more patchy organization apparent with physiological mapping (Robertson 1987). The results suggest that several unique features of the olivocerebellar circuit may contribute to the appearance of zonal organization using anatomical techniques, but that the detailed patterns of patchy tactile projections seen with physiological techniques are a more accurate representation of the afferent organization of this region of cortex. 1 INTRODUCTION Determining the detailed anatomical structure of the nervous system has been a major focus of neurob",Computer Vision,084b6fbb10729ed4da8c3d3f5a3ae7c9-Paper.pdf,1989
Generalization and scaling in reinforcement,"In associative reinforcement learning, an environment generates input vectors, a learning system generates possible output vectors, and a re inforcement function computes feedback signals from the input-output pairs. The task is to discover and remember input-output pairs that generate rewards. Especially difficult cases occur when rewards are rare, since the expected time for any algorithm can grow exponentially with the size of the problem. Nonetheless, if a reinforcement function possesses regularities, and a learning algorithm exploits them, learning time can be reduced below that of non-generalizing algorithms. This paper describes a neural network algorithm called complementary re inforcement back-propagation (CRBP), and reports simulation results on problems designed to offer differing opportunities for generalization. 1 REINFORCEMENT LEARNING REQUIRES SEARCH Reinforcement learning (Sutton, 1984; Barto & Anandan, 1985; Ackley, 1988; Allen, 1989) requires more from a learner than",Reinforcement Learning,091d584fced301b442654dd8c23b3fc9-Paper.pdf,1989
Neural Network Weight Matrix Synthesis Using,"Given a set of input-output training samples, we describe a proce dure for determining the time sequence of weights for a dynamic neural network to model an arbitrary input-output process. We formulate the input-output mapping problem as an optimal con trol problem, defining a performance index to be minimized as a function of time-varying weights. We solve the resulting nonlin ear two-point-boundary-value problem, and this yields the training rule. For the performance index chosen, this rule turns out to be a continuous time generalization of the outer product rule earlier sug gested heuristically by Hopfield for designing associative memories.

Collective Oscillations in the,"The firing patterns of populations of cells in the cat visual cor tex can exhibit oscillatory responses in the range of 35 - 85 Hz. Furthermore, groups of neurons many mm's apart can be highly synchronized as long as the cells have similar orientation tuning. We investigate two basic network architectures that incorporate ei ther nearest-neighbor or global feedback interactions and conclude that non-local feedback plays a fundamental role in the initial syn chronization and dynamic stability of the oscillations. 1 INTRODUCTION 40 - 60 Hz oscillations have long been reported in the rat and rabbit olfactory bulb and cortex on the basis of single- and multi-unit recordings as well as EEG activity (Freeman, 1972; Wilson & Bower 1990).

Operational Fault Tolerance,"The performance sensitivity of Albus' CMAC network was studied for the scenario in which faults are introduced into the adjustable weights after training has been accomplished. It was found that fault sensitivity was reduced with increased generalization when ""loss of weight"" faults were considered, but sensitivity was increased for ""saturated weight"" faults. 1 INTRODUCTION Fault-tolerance is often cited as an inherent property of neural networks, and is thought by many to be a natural consequence of ""massively parallel"" computational architectures. Numerous anecdotal reports of fault-tolerance experiments, primarily in pattern classification tasks, abound in the literature. However, there has been surprisingly little rigorous investigation of the fault-tolerance properties of various network architectures in other application areas.

Effects of Firing Synchrony on Signal,"Spiking neurons which integrate to threshold and fire were used to study the transmission of frequency modulated (FM) signals through layered networks. Firing correlations between cells in the input layer were found to modulate the transmission of FM sig nals under certain dynamical conditions. A tonic level of activity was maintained by providing each cell with a source of Poisson distributed synaptic input. When the average membrane depo larization produced by the synaptic input was sufficiently below threshold, the firing correlations between cells in the input layer could greatly amplify the signal present in subsequent layers. When the depolarization was sufficiently close to threshold, however, the firing synchrony between cells in the initial layers could no longer effect the propagation of FM signals. In this latter case, integrate and-fire neurons could be effectively modeled by simpler analog elements governed by a linear input-output relation. 1 Introduction Physiologists ha",Reinforcement Learning,115f89503138416a242f40fb7d7f338e-Paper.pdf,1989
Acoustic-Imaging Computations by Echolocating Bats:,"The echolocating bat, Eptesicus fuscus, perceives the distance to sonar targets from the delay of echoes and the shape of targets from the spectrum of echoes. However, shape is perceived in terms of the target's range proftle. The time separation of echo components from parts of the target located at different distances is reconstructed from the echo spectrum and added to the estimate of absolute delay already derived from the arrival-time of echoes. The bat thus perceives the distance to targets and depth within targets along the same psychological range dimension, which is computed. The image corresponds to the crosscorrelation function of echoes. Fusion of physiologically distinct time- and frequency-domain representations into a fmal, common time-domain image illustrates the binding of within modality features into a unified, whole image. To support the structure of images along the dimension of range, bats can perceive echo delay with a hyperacuity of 10 nanoseconds.

Time DependentAdaptive Neural Networks,"A comparison of algorithms that minimize error functions to train the trajectories of recurrent networks, reveals how complexity is traded off for causality. These algorithms are also related to time-independent fonnalisms. It is suggested that causal and scalable algorithms are possible when the activation dynamics of adaptive neurons is fast compared to the behavior to be learned. Standard continuous-time recurrent backpropagation is used in an example. 1 INTRODUCTION Training the time dependent behavior of a neural network model involves the minimization of a function that measures the difference between an actual trajectory and a desired trajectory. The standard method of accomplishing this minimization is to calculate the gradient of an error function with respect to the weights of the system and then to use the gradient in a minimization algorithm (e.g. gradient descent or conjugate gradient).

More over, the resulting neural network requires a vanishingly small pro portion O(log n/n) of the memory that would be required for com plete storage of the patterns. Further, the perceptron algorithm takes O(n2) arithmetic operations with high probability, whereas other methods such as linear programming takes O(n3.5) in the worst case.

Speaker Independent Speech Recognition with,"We attempt to combine neural networks with knowledge from speech science to build a speaker independent speech recogni tion system. This knowledge is utilized in designing the preprocessing, input coding, output coding, output supervision and architectural constraints. To handle the temporal aspect of speech we combine delays, copies of activations of hidden and output units at the input level, and Back-Propagation for Sequences (BPS), a learning algorithm for networks with local self-loops. This strategy is demonstrated in several experi ments, in particular a nasal discrimination task for which the application of a speech theory hypothesis dramatically im proved generalization. 1 INTRODUCTION The strategy put forward in this research effort is to combine the flexibility and learning abilities of neural networks with as much knowledge from speech science as possible in order to build a speaker independent automatic speech recognition system.

Analytic Solutions to the Formation of,"Analytic solutions to the information-theoretic evolution equa tion of the connection strength of a three-layer feedforward neural net for visual information processing are presented. The results are (1) the receptive fields of the feature-analysing cells corre spond to the eigenvector of the maximum eigenvalue of the Fred holm integral equation of the first kind derived from the evolution equation of the connection strength; (2) a symmetry-breaking mechanism (parity-violation) has been identified to be respon sible for the changes of the morphology of the receptive field; (3) the conditions for the formation of different morphologies are explicitly identified. 1 INTRODUCTION The use of Shannon's information theory ( Shannon and Weaver,1949) to the study of neural nets has been shown to be very instructive in explaining the formation of different receptive fi~lds in the early visual information processing, as evident by the works of Linsker (1986,1988).

An Analog VLSI Model of Adaptation,"The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is the primary mechanism that controls the compensatory eye movements that stabilize retinal im ages during rapid head motion. The primary pathways of this sys tem are feed-forward, with inputs from the semicircular canals and outputs to the oculomotor system. Since visual feedback is not used directly in the VOR computation, the system must exploit motor learning to perform correctly. Lisberger(1988) has proposed a model for adapting the VOR gain using image-slip information from the retina. We have designed and tested analog very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuitry that implements a simplified ver sion of Lisberger's adaptive VOR model. 1 INTRODUCTION A characteristic commonly found in biological systems is their ability to adapt their function based on their inputs. The combination of the need for precision and the variability inherent in the environment necessitates such learning in organisms.

A Reconfigurable Analog VLSI Neural Network,"1024 distributed-neuron synapses have been integrated in an active area of 6.1mm x 3.3mm using a 0.9p.m, double-metal, single-poly, n-well CMOS technology. The distributed-neuron synapses are ar ranged in blocks of 16, which we call '4 x 4 tiles'. Switch matrices are interleaved between each of these tiles to provide programma bility of interconnections. With a small area overhead (15 %), the 1024 units of the network can be rearranged in various configura tions. Some of the possible configurations are, a 12-32-12 network, a 16-12-12-16 network, two 12-32 networks etc. (the numbers sep arated by dashes indicate the number of units per layer, including the input layer). Weights are stored in analog form on MaS ca pacitors. The synaptic weights are usable to a resolution of 1% of their full scale value. The limitation arises due to charge injection from the access switch and charge leakage. Other parameters like gain and shape of nonlinearity are also programmable.

Handwritten Digit Recognition with a,"We present an application of back-propagation networks to hand written digit recognition. Minimal preprocessing of the data was required, but architecture of the network was highly constrained and specifically designed for the task. The input of the network consists of normalized images of isolated digits. The method has 1% error rate and about a 9% reject rate on zipcode digits provided by the U.S. Postal Service. 1 INTRODUCTION The main point of this paper is to show that large back-propagation (BP) net works can be applied to real image-recognition problems without a large, complex preprocessing stage requiring detailed engineering. Unlike most previous work on the subject (Denker et al., 1989), the learning network is directly fed with images, rather than feature vectors, thus demonstrating the ability of BP networks to deal with large amounts of low level information. Previous work performed on simple digit images (Le Cun, 1989) showed that the architecture of the network strongly",Computer Vision,53c3bce66e43be4f209556518c2fcb54-Paper.pdf,1989

Computational Efficiency:,"It is well-known that neural responses in particular brain regions are spatially organized, but no general principles have been de veloped that relate the structure of a brain map to the nature of the associated computation. On parallel computers, maps of a sort quite similar to brain maps arise when a computation is distributed across multiple processors. In this paper we will discuss the rela tionship between maps and computations on these computers and suggest how similar considerations might also apply to maps in the brain. 1 INTRODUCTION A great deal of effort in experimental and theoretical neuroscience is devoted to recording and interpreting spatial patterns of neural activity. A variety of map patterns have been observed in different brain regions and, presumably, these pat terns reflect something about the nature of the neural computations being carried out in these regions. To date, however, there have been no general principles for interpreting the structure of a brain map ",Reinforcement Learning,577ef1154f3240ad5b9b413aa7346a1e-Paper.pdf,1989
A Cost Function for Internal Representations,"We introduce a cost function for learning in feed-forward neural networks which is an explicit function of the internal representa tion in addition to the weights. The learning problem can then be formulated as two simple perceptrons and a search for internal representations. Back-propagation is recovered as a limit. The frequency of successful solutions is better for this algorithm than for back-propagation when weights and hidden units are updated on the same timescale i.e. once every learning step. 1 INTRODUCTION In their review of back-propagation in layered networks, Rumelhart et al. (1986) describe the learning process in terms of finding good ""internal representations"" of the input patterns on the hidden units. However, the search for these representa tions is an indirect one, since the variables which are adjusted in its course are the connection weights, not the activations of the hidden units themselves when specific input patterns are fed into the input layer.

HMM Speech Recognition,"Two approaches were explored which integrate neural net classifiers with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) speech recognizers. Both at tempt to improve speech pattern discrimination while retaining the temporal processing advantages of HMMs. One approach used neu ral nets to provide second-stage discrimination following an HMM recognizer. On a small vocabulary task, Radial Basis Function (RBF) and back-propagation neural nets reduced the error rate substantially (from 7.9% to 4.2% for the RBF classifier). In a larger vocabulary task, neural net classifiers did not reduce the error rate. They, however, outperformed Gaussian, Gaussian mixture, and k nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers. In another approach, neural nets functioned as low-level acoustic-phonetic feature extractors. When classifying phonemes based on single 10 msec. frames, dis criminant RBF neural net classifiers outperformed Gaussian mix ture classifiers. Performance, however, differed little when classi fying phones by accumulatin",NLP,58a2fc6ed39fd083f55d4182bf88826d-Paper.pdf,1989
Generalization and Parameter Estimation,"We have done an empirical study of the relation of the number of parameters (weights) in a feedforward net to generalization perfor mance. Two experiments are reported. In one, we use simulated data sets with well-controlled parameters, such as the signal-to-noise ratio of continuous-valued data. In the second, we train the network on vector-quantized mel cepstra from real speech samples. In each case, we use back-propagation to train the feedforward net to discriminate in a multiple class pattern classification problem. We report the results of these studies, and show the application of cross-validation techniques to prevent overfitting. 1 INTRODUCTION It is well known that system models which have too many parameters (with respect to the number of measurements) do not generalize well to new measurements. For instance, an autoregressive (AR) model can be derived which will represent the training data with no error by using as many parameters as there are data points.

The Effects of Circuit Integration on a Feature,"The effects of parameter modifications imposed by hardware con straints on a self-organizing feature map algorithm were examined. Performance was measured by the error rate of a speech recogni tion system which included this algorithm as part of the front-end processing. System parameters which were varied included weight (connection strength) quantization, adap tation quantization, dis tance measures and circuit approximations which include device characteristics and process variability. Experiments using the TI isolated word database for 16 speakers demonstrated degradation in performance when weight quantization fell below 8 bits. The com petitive nature of the algorithm rela..xes constraints on uniformity and linearity which makes it an excellent candidate for a fully ana log circuit implementation.

VLSI Implementation of a High-Capacity,"In this paper we describe the VLSI design and testing of a high capacity associative memory which we call the exponential cor relation associative memory (ECAM). The prototype 3J.'-CMOS programmable chip is capable of storing 32 memory patterns of 24 bits each. The high capacity of the ECAM is partly due to the use of special exponentiation neurons, which are implemented via sub-threshold MOS transistors in this design. The prototype chip is capable of performing one associative recall in 3 J.'S. 1 ARCHITECTURE Previously (Chiueh, 1989), we have proposed a general model for correlation-based associative memories, which includes a variant of the Hopfield memory and high order correlation memories as special cases. This new exponential correlation as sociative memory (ECAM) possesses a very large storage capacity, which scales exponentially with the length of memory patterns (Chiueh, 1988). Furthermore, it has been shown that the ECAM is asymptotically stable in both synchronous and 1 Tz",Computer Vision,63dc7ed1010d3c3b8269faf0ba7491d4-Paper.pdf,1989
The Cascade-Correlation Learning Architecture,"Cascade-Correlation is a new architecture and supervised learning algo rithm for artificial neural networks. Instead of just adjusting the weights in a network of fixed topology. Cascade-Correlation begins with a min imal network, then automatically trains and adds new hidden units one by one, creating a multi-layer structure. Once a new hidden unit has been added to the network, its input-side weights are frozen. This unit then becomes a permanent feature-detector in the network, available for producing outputs or for creating other, more complex feature detec tors. The Cascade-Correlation architecture has several advantages over existing algorithms: it learns very quickly, the network .d etermines its own size and topology, it retains the structures it has built even if the training set changes, and it requires no back-propagation of error signals through the connections of the network. 1 DESCRIPTION OF CASCADEÂ·CORRELATION The most important problem preventing the widespread applicat",Deep Learning,69adc1e107f7f7d035d7baf04342e1ca-Paper.pdf,1989

We show that a particular style of network learning algorithm based on locally-tuned receptive fields maps naturally onto cortical hardware, and gives coherence to a variety of features of cortical anatomy, physiology, and biophysics whose relations to learning remain poorly understood. 1 INTRODUCTION Synaptic modification is widely believed to be the brain's primary mechanism for long-term information storage. The enormous practical and theoretical importance of biological synaptic plasticity has stimulated interest among both experimental neuroscientists and neural network modelers, and has provided strong incentive for the development of computational models that can both explain and predict.

Optimal Brain Damage,"We have used information-theoretic ideas to derive a class of prac tical and nearly optimal schemes for adapting the size of a neural network. By removing unimportant weights from a network, sev eral improvements can be expected: better generalization, fewer training examples required, and improved speed of learning and/or classification. The basic idea is to use second-derivative informa tion to make a tradeoff between network complexity and training set error. Experiments confirm the usefulness of the methods on a real-world application. 1 INTRODUCTION Most successful applications of neural network learning to real-world problems have been achieved using highly structured networks of rather large size [for example (Waibel, 1989; Le Cun et al., 1990a)]. As applications become more complex, the networks will presumably become even larger and more structured.

This builds upon our existing system (Seibert & Waxman, 1989) which processes 20 shapes and classifies t.hem into view categories (i.e., aspects) invariant to illumination, position, orientat.ion, scale, and projective deformations. From a sequence 'of views, the aspect network learns the transitions be tween these aspects, crystallizing a graph-like structure from an initially amorphous network. Object recognition emerges by ac cumulating evidence over multiple views which activate competing object hypotheses. 1 INTRODUCTION One can ""learn"" a three-dimensional object by exploring it and noticing how its appearance changes.

The Effect of Catecholamines on Performance:,"At the level of individual neurons. catecholamine release increases the responsivity of cells to excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We present a model of catecholamine effects in a network of neural-like elements. We argue that changes in the responsivity of individual elements do not affect their ability to detect a signal and ignore noise. However. the same changes in cell responsivity in a network of such elements do improve the signal detection performance of the network as a whole. We show how this result can be used in a computer simulation of behavior to account for the effect of eNS stimulants on the signal detection performance of human subjects. 1 Introduction The catecholamines-norepinephrine and dopamine-are neuroactive substances that are presumed to modulate information processing in the brain, rather than to convey discrete sensory or motor signals.

Meiosis Networks,"A central problem in connectionist modelling is the control of network and architectural resources during learning. In the present approach, weights reflect a coarse prediction history as coded by a distribution of values and parameterized in the mean and standard deviation of these weight distributions. Weight updates are a function of both the mean and standard deviation of each connection in the network and vary as a function of the error signal (""stochastic delta rule""; Hanson, 1990). Consequently, the weights maintain information on their central tendency and their ""uncertainty"" in prediction. Such information is useful in establishing a policy concerning the size of the nodal complexity of the network and growth of new nodes. For example, during problem solving the present network can undergo ""meiosis"", producing two nodes where there was one ""overtaxed"" node as measured by its coefficient of variation. It is shown in a number of benchmark problems that meiosis networks can find ",Deep Learning,705f2172834666788607efbfca35afb3-Paper.pdf,1989
Synergy Of Clustering Multiple Back Propagation Networks,"The properties of a cluster of multiple back-propagation (BP) networks are examined and compared to the performance of a single BP net work. The underlying idea is that a synergistic effect within the cluster improves the perfonnance and fault tolerance. Five networks were ini tially trained to perfonn the same input-output mapping. Following training, a cluster was created by computing an average of the outputs generated by the individual networks. The output of the cluster can be used as the desired output during training by feeding it back to the indi vidual networks.

Reading a Neural Code,"Traditional methods of studying neural coding characterize the en coding of known stimuli in average neural responses. Organisms face nearly the opposite task - decoding short segments of a spike train to extract information about an unknown, time-varying stim ulus. Here we present strategies for characterizing the neural code from the point of view of the organism, culminating in algorithms for real-time stimulus reconstruction based on a single sample of the spike train. These methods are applied to the design and anal ysis of experiments on an identified movement-sensitive neuron in the fly visual system.

A Method for the Associative Storage,"A method for storing analog vectors in Hopfield's continuous feed back model is proposed. By analog vectors we mean vectors whose components are real-valued. The vectors to be stored are set as equilibria of the network. The network model consists of one layer of visible neurons and one layer of hidden neurons. We propose a learning algorithm, which results in adjusting the positions of the equilibria, as well as guaranteeing their stability. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the method. 1 INTRODUCTION The associative storage of binary vectors using discrete feedback neural nets has been demonstrated by Hopfield (1982). This has attracted a lot of attention, and a number of alternative techniques using also the discrete feedback model have appeared. However, the problem of the distributed associative storage of analog vectors has received little attention in literature. By analog vectors we mean vec tors whose components are real-valued.

Using Local Models to Control Movement,"This paper explores the use of a model neural network for motor learning. Steinbuch and Taylor presented neural network designs to do nearest neighbor lookup in the early 1960s. In this paper their nearest neighbor network is augmented with a local model network, which fits a local model to a set of nearest neighbors. The network design is equivalent to local regression. This network architecture can represent smooth nonlinear functions, yet has simple training rules with a single global optimum. The network has been used for motor learning of a simulated arm and a simulated running machine. 1 INTRODUCTION A common problem in motor learning is approximating a continuous function from samples of the function's inputs and outputs.

We extend previous work by considering how this methodology can be applied to the optimization of quantities that are distal not only in space but also in time. In many learning control problems, the output variables of the controller are not the natural coordinates in which to specify tasks and evaluate performance. Tasks are generally more naturally specified in ""distal"" coordinate systems (e.g., endpoint coordinates for manipulator motion) than in the ""proximal"" coordinate system of the controller (e.g., joint angles or torques).

From sequential input, one word at a time, our networks learn to do semantic role assignment, noun phrase attachment, and clause structure recognition for sentences with passive constructions and center embedded clauses. The networks make syntactic and semantic predictions at every point in time, and previous predictions are revised as expectations are affirmed or violated with the arrival of new informa tion.

Dynamic Behavior of Constrained,"The learning dynamics of the back-propagation algorithm are in vestigated when complexity constraints are added to the standard Least Mean Square (LMS) cost function.

Furthermore, ""energy,"" hidden representations and weight distributions are observed and compared during learning. An attempt is made at explaining the results in terms of linear and non-linear effects in relation to the gradient descent learning algorithm. 1 INTRODUCTION It is generally admitted that generalization performance of back-propagation net works (Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams, 1986) will depend on the relative size ofthe training data and of the trained network. By analogy to curve-fitting and for theo retical considerations, the generalization performance of the network should de crease as the size of the network and the associated number of degrees of freedom increase (Rumelhart, 1987;",Optimization & Theoretical ML,85d8ce590ad8981ca2c8286f79f59954-Paper.pdf,1989

A Computational Basis for Phonology,"The phonological structure of human languages is intricate, yet highly constrained. Through a combination of connectionist modeling and linguistic analysis, we are attempting to develop a computational basis for the nature of phonology. We present a connectionist architecture that performs multiple simultaneous insertion, deletion, and mutation operations on sequences of phonemes, and introduce a novel additional primitive, clustering. Clustering provides an interesting alternative to both iterative and relaxation accounts of assimilation processes such as vowel harmony. Our resulting model is efficient because it processes utterances entirely in parallel using only feed-forward circuitry. 1 INTRODUCTION Phonological phenomena can be quite complex, but human phonological behavior is also highly constrained.

A Neural Network for Feature Extraction,"The paper suggests a statistical framework for the parameter esti mation problem associated with unsupervised learning in a neural network, leading to an exploratory projection pursuit network that performs feature extraction, or dimensionality reduction. 1 INTRODUCTION The search for a possible presence of some unspecified structure in a high dimen sional space can be difficult due to the curse of dimensionality problem, namely the inherent sparsity of high dimensional spaces. Due to this problem, uniformly accurate estimations for all smooth functions are not possible in high dimensions with practical sample sizes (Cox, 1984, Barron, 1988). Recently, exploratory projection pursuit (PP) has been considered (Jones, 1983) as a potential method for overcoming the curse of dimensionality problem (Huber, 1985), and new algorithms were suggested by Friedman (1987), and by Hall (1988, 1989).

The fIrst method is based on treating the regular grammar as a I-dimensional Markov source, and the second is based on the combinatoric characteristics of the regular grammar itself. We apply the resulting Bayes criteria to a particular example in order to show the efficiency of each method. 1 MOTIVATION We are interested in segmenting electron-microscope autoradiography (EMA) images by learning representational models for the textures found in the EMA image. In studying this problem, we have recognized that both structural and statistical features may be useful for characterizing textures. This has motivated us to study the source modeling problem for both structural sources and statistical sources. The statistical sources that we have examined are the class of one and two-dimensional Markov sources (see",NLP,9b04d152845ec0a378394003c96da594-Paper.pdf,1989
Dataflow Architectures:,"Dataflow architectures are general computation engines optimized for the execution of fme-grain parallel algorithms.

This is surprisingly fast, as ""standard"" approaches involve 7') solution of a linear programming problem involving O( constraints in n dimen sions. A modification of Valiant's distribution independent protocol for learning is proposed in which the distribution and the function to be learned may be cho sen by adversaries, however these adversaries may not communicate. It is argued that this definition is more reasonable and applicable to real world learning than Valiant's. Under this definition, the Perceptron algorithm is shown to be a distri bution independent learning algorithm.

Discovering high order features with mean field,"A new form of the deterministic Boltzmann machine (DBM) learn ing procedure is presented which can efficiently train network mod ules to discriminate between input vectors according to some cri terion. The new technique directly utilizes the free energy of these ""mean field modules"" to represent the probability that the criterion is met, the free energy being readily manipulated by the learning procedure. Although conventional deterministic Boltzmann learn ing fails to extract the higher order feature of shift at a network bottleneck, combining the new mean field modules with the mu tual information objective function rapidly produces modules that perfectly extract this important higher order feature without direct external supervision. 1 INTRODUCTION The Boltzmann machine learning procedure (Hinton and Sejnowski, 1986) can be made much more efficient by using a mean field approximation in which stochastic binary units are replaced by deterministic real-valued units (Peterson and Ander",Deep Learning,a4f23670e1833f3fdb077ca70bbd5d66-Paper.pdf,1989
Sequential Decision Problems,"Decision making tasks that involve delayed consequences are very common yet difficult to address with supervised learning methods. If there is an accurate model of the underlying dynamical system, then these tasks can be formulated as sequential decision problems and solved by Dynamic Programming. This paper discusses rein forcement learning in terms of the sequential decision framework and shows how a learning algorithm similar to the one implemented by the Adaptive Critic Element used in the pole-balancer of Barto, Sutton, and Anderson (1983), and further developed by Sutton (1984), fits into this framework. Adaptive neural networks can play significant roles as modules for approximating the functions required for solving sequential decision problems. 1 INTRODUCTION Most neural network research on learning assumes the existence of a supervisor or teacher knowledgeable enough to supply desired, or target, network outputs during training.

Asymptotic Convergence of Backpropagation:,"We have calculated, both analytically and in simulations, the rate of convergence at long times in the backpropagation learning al gorithm for networks with and without hidden units. Our basic finding for units using the standard sigmoid transfer function is lit convergence of the error for large t, with at most logarithmic cor rections for networks with hidden units. Other transfer functions may lead to a 8lower polynomial rate of convergence. Our analytic calculations were presented in (Tesauro, He & Ahamd, 1989). Here we focus in more detail on our empirical measurements of the con vergence rate in numerical simulations, which confirm our analytic results. 1 INTRODUCTION Backpropagation is a popular learning algorithm for multilayer neural networks which minimizes a global error function by gradient descent (Werbos, 1974: Parker, 1985; LeCun, 1985; Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams, 1986).

Training Connectionist Networks with,"""Selective sampling"" is a form of directed search that can greatly increase the ability of a connectionist network to generalize accu rately. Based on information from previous batches of samples, a network may be trained on data selectively sampled from regions in the domain that are unknown. This is realizable in cases when the distribution is known, or when the cost of drawing points from the target distribution is negligible compared to the cost of label ing them with the proper classification. The approach is justified by its applicability to the problem of training a network for power system security analysis. The benefits of selective sampling are studied analytically, and the results are confirmed experimentally. 1 Introduction: Random Sampling vs. Directed Search A great deal of attention has been applied to the problem of generalization based on random samples drawn from a distribution, frequently referred to as ""learning from examples.""

A Systematic Study of the Input/Output Properties,"The input/output properties of a 2 compartment model neuron are systematically explored. Taken from the work of MacGregor (MacGregor, 1987), the model neuron compartments contain several active conductances, including a potassium conductance in the dendritic compartment driven by the accumulation of intradendritic calcium. Dynamics of the conductances and potentials are governed by a set of coupled first order differential equations which are integrated numerically. There are a set of 17 internal parameters to this model, specificying conductance rate constants, time constants, thresholds, etc. To study parameter sensitivity, a set of trials were run in which the input driving the neuron is kept fixed while each internal parameter is varied with all others left fixed.

It is therefore of considerable interest to understand the neural basis of these motivational states. Drawing upon work on the neural basis of feeding in the marine mollusc Aplysia, we have developed a heterogeneous artificial neural network for con trolling the feeding behavior of a simulated insect. We demonstrate that feeding in this artificial insect shares many characteristics with the motivated behavior of natural animals. 1 INTRODUCTION While an animal's external environment certainly plays an extremely important role in shaping its actions, the behavior of even simpler animals is by no means solely reactive.

HIGHER ORDER RECURRENT NETWORKS,"A higher order single layer recursive network easily learns to simulate a deterministic finite state machine and recognize regular grammars. When an enhanced version of this neural net state machine is connected through a common error term to an external analog stack memory, the combination can be interpreted as a neural net pushdown automata. The neural net finite state machine is given the primitives, push and POP. and is able to read the top of the stack. Through a gradient descent learning rule derived from the common error function, the hybrid network learns to effectively use the stack actions to manipUlate the stack memory and to learn simple context free grammars.

Error rates were statistically equivalent on almost all tasks, but classifiers differed by orders of magnitude in memory requirements, training time, classification time, and ease of adaptivity. Nearest-neighbor classifiers trained rapidly but re quired the most memory. Tree classifiers provided rapid classifica tion but were complex to adapt.

Contour-Map Encoding of Shape for Early Vision,"Contour maps provide a general method for recognizing two-dimensional shapes. All but blank images give rise to such maps, and people are good at recognizing objects and shapes from them. The maps are encoded easily in long feature vectors that are suitable for recognition by an associative memory. These properties of contour maps suggest a role for them in early visual perception. The prevalence of direction-sensitive neurons in the visual cortex of mammals supports this view. INTRODUCTION Early vision refers here to the first stages of visual perception of an experienced (adult human) observer. Overall, visual perception results in the identification of what is being viewed: We recognize an image as the letter A because it looks to us like other As we have seen. Early vision is the beginning of this process of identification- the making of the first guess. Early vision cannot be based on special or salient features. For example, we normally think of the letter A as being composed of ",Computer Vision,cfecdb276f634854f3ef915e2e980c31-Paper.pdf,1989
Maximum Likelihood Competitive Learning,"One popular class of unsupervised algorithms are competitive algo rithms. In the traditional view of competition, only one competitor, the winner, adapts for any given case. I propose to view compet itive adaptation as attempting to fit a blend of simple probability generators (such as gaussians) to a set of data-points. The maxi mum likelihood fit of a model of this type suggests a ""softer"" form of competition, in which all competitors adapt in proportion to the relative probability that the input came from each competitor.

Note on Development of Modularity,"The existence of modularity in the organization of nervous systems (e.g. cortical columns and olfactory glomeruli) is well known. We show that localized activity patterns in a layer of cells, collective excitations, can induce the formation of modular structures in the anatomical connections via a Hebbian learning mechanism. The networks are spatially homogeneous before learning, but the spon taneous emergence of localized collective excitations and subse quently modularity in the connection patterns breaks translational symmetry. This spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon is similar to those which drive pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems. We have identified requirements on the patterns of lateral connections and on the gains of internal units which are essential for the development of modularity. These essential requirements will most likely remain operative when more complicated (and bi ologically realistic) models are considered. 1 Present Address: Molecular and Cell",Optimization & Theoretical ML,d395771085aab05244a4fb8fd91bf4ee-Paper.pdf,1989

Using A Translation-Invariant Neural Network,Distinctive electrocardiogram (EeG) patterns are created when the heart is beating normally and when a dangerous arrhythmia is present.

The input to such a network must be translation-invariant. since the distinctive features of the EeG may appear anywhere in an arbritrarily-chosen EeG segment.

Non-Boltzmann Dynamics in Networks of,"We study networks of spiking neurons in which spikes are fired as a Poisson process. The state of a cell is determined by the instan taneous firing rate, and in the limit of high firing rates our model reduces to that studied by Hopfield. We find that the inclusion of spiking results in several new features, such as a noise-induced asymmetry between ""on"" and ""off"" states of the cells and probabil ity currents which destroy the usual description of network dynam ics in terms of energy surfaces. Taking account of spikes also al lows us to calibrate network parameters such as ""synaptic weights"" against experiments on real synapses.

This stabilization process is similar to the vestibulo-ocular response (VOR); like the VOR, A-eye learns a system model that can be incrementally modified to adapt to changes in its structure, performance and environment. A-eye is an example of a robust sen sory system that performs computations that can be of significant use to the designers of mobile robots. 1 Introduction We have constructed an ""artificial eye"" (A-eye), an autonomous robot that incorpo rates a two axis camera positioning system (figure 1). Like a the human oculomotor system, A-eye can estimate the rotation rate of its body with a gyroscope and esti mate the rotation rate of its ""eye"" by measuring image slip acr~ its ""retina"".

Combining Visual and Acoustic Speech Signals,"Acoustic speech recognition degrades in the presence of noise. Com pensatory information is available from the visual speech signals around the speaker's mouth. Previous attempts at using these visual speech signals to improve automatic speech recognition sys tems have combined the acoustic and visual speech information at a symbolic level using heuristic rules. In this paper, we demonstrate an alternative approach to fusing the visual and acoustic speech information by training feedforward neural networks to map the visual signal onto the corresponding short-term spectral amplitude envelope (STSAE) of the acoustic signal. This information can be directly combined with the degraded acoustic STSAE. Signif icant improvements are demonstrated in vowel recognition from noise-degraded acoustic signals. These results are compared to the performance of humans, as well as other pattern matching and es timation algorithms. 1 INTRODUCTION Current automatic speech recognition systems rely almost ",Computer Vision,f90f2aca5c640289d0a29417bcb63a37-Paper.pdf,1989
The Computation of Sound Source Elevation,"The midbrain of the barn owl contains a map-like representation of sound source direction which is used to precisely orient the head to ward targets of interest. Elevation is computed from the interaural difference in sound level. We present models and computer simula tions of two stages of level difference processing which qualitatively agree with known anatomy and physiology, and make several strik ing predictions. 1 INTRODUCTION The auditory system of the barn owl constructs a map of sound direction in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (lex) after several stages of processing the output of the cochlea. This representation of space enables the owl to orient its head to sounds with an accuracy greater than any other tested land animal [Knudsen, et aI, 1979]. Elevation and azimuth are processed in separate streams before being merged in the ICx [Konishi, 1986].

Modeling Time Varying Systems,"Multi-layered neural networks have recently been proposed for non linear prediction and system modeling. Although proven successful for modeling time invariant nonlinear systems, the inability of neural networks to characterize temporal variability has so far been an obstacle in applying them to complicated non stationary signals, such as speech. In this paper we present a network architecture, called ""Hidden Control Neural Network"" (HCNN), for modeling signals generated by nonlinear dynamical systems with restricted time variability. The approach taken here is to allow the mapping that is implemented by a multi layered neural network to change with time as a function of an additional control input signal. This network is trained using an algorithm that is based on ""back-propagation"" and segmentation algorithms for estimating the unknown control together with the network's parameters. The HCNN approach was applied to several tasks including modeling of time-varying nonlinear systems an",Deep Learning,00411460f7c92d2124a67ea0f4cb5f85-Paper.pdf,1990
Using Genetic Algorithms to Improve,"Genetic algorithms were used to select and create features and to select reference exemplar patterns for machine vision and speech pattern classi fication tasks. For a complex speech recognition task, genetic algorithms required no more computation time than traditional approaches to feature selection but reduced the number of input features required by a factor of five (from 153 to 33 features). On a difficult artificial machine-vision task, genetic algorithms were able to create new features (polynomial functions of the original features) which reduced classification error rates from 19% to almost 0%. Neural net and k nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers were unable to provide such low error rates using only the original features. Ge netic algorithms were also used to reduce the number of reference exemplar patterns for a KNN classifier. On a 338 training pattern vowel-recognition problem with 10 classes, genetic algorithms reduced the number of stored exemplars from 338 to 43 without ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,00ec53c4682d36f5c4359f4ae7bd7ba1-Paper.pdf,1990
Generalization Dynamics in,"For a simple linear case, a mathematical analysis of the training and gener alization (validation) performance of networks trained by gradient descent on a Least Mean Square cost function is provided as a function of the learn ing parameters and of the statistics of the training data base. The analysis predicts that generalization error dynamics are very dependent on a pri ori initial weights. In particular, the generalization error might sometimes weave within a computable range during extended training. In some cases, the analysis provides bounds on the optimal number of training cycles for minimal validation error. For a speech labeling task, predicted weaving effects were qualitatively tested and observed by computer simulations in networks trained by the linear and non-linear back-propagation algorithm. 1 INTRODUCTION Recent progress in network design demonstrates that non-linear feedforward neu ral networks can perform impressive pattern classification for a variety of real-world",Optimization & Theoretical ML,01386bd6d8e091c2ab4c7c7de644d37b-Paper.pdf,1990

Oscillation Onset,"This paper studies dynamical aspects of neural systems with delayed neg ative feedback modelled by nonlinear delay-differential equations. These systems undergo a Hopf bifurcation from a stable fixed point to a sta ble limit cycle oscillation as certain parameters are varied. It is shown that their frequency of oscillation is robust to parameter variations and noisy fluctuations, a property that makes these systems good candidates for pacemakers. The onset of oscillation is postponed by both additive and parametric noise in the sense that the state variable spends more time near the fixed point than it would in the absence of noise. This is also the case when noise affects the delayed variable, i.e. when the system has a faulty memory. Finally, it is shown that a distribution of delays (rather than a fixed delay) also stabilizes the fixed point solution. 1 INTRODUCTION In this paper, we study the dynamics of a class of neural delayed feedback models which have been used to understand e",Optimization & Theoretical ML,04025959b191f8f9de3f924f0940515f-Paper.pdf,1990
Relaxation Networks for Large Supervised Learning Problems,Feedback connections are required so that the teacher signal on the output neurons can modify weights during supervised learning. Relaxation methods are needed for learning static patterns with full-time feedback connections. Feedback network learning techniques have not achieved wide popularity because of the still greater computational efficiency of back-propagation. We show by simulation that relaxation networks of the kind we are implementing in VLSI are capable of learning large problems just like back-propagation networks. A microchip incorporates deterministic mean-field theory learning as well as stochastic Boltzmann learning. A multiple-chip electronic system implementing these networks will make high-speed parallel learning in them feasible in the future.,Optimization & Theoretical ML,05049e90fa4f5039a8cadc6acbb4b2cc-Paper.pdf,1990
Neural Networks Structured for Control,"We present a generic neural network architecture capable of con trolling non-linear plants. The network is composed of dynamic. parallel, linear maps gated by non-linear switches. Using a recur rent form of the back-propagation algorithm, control is achieved by optimizing the control gains and task-adapted switch parame ters. A mean quadratic cost function computed across a nominal plant trajectory is minimized along with performance constraint penalties. The approach is demonstrated for a control task con sisting of landing a commercial aircraft in difficult wind conditions. We show that the network yields excellent performance while re maining within acceptable damping response constraints. 1 INTRODUCTION This paper illustrates how a recurrent back-propagation neural network algorithm (Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams, 1986) may be exploited as a procedure for con trolling complex systems.

Closed-Form Inversion of Backpropagation,"We describe a closed-form technique for mapping the output of a trained backpropagation network int.o input activity space. The mapping is an in verse mapping in the sense that, when the image of the mapping in input activity space is propagat.ed forward through the normal network dynam ics, it reproduces the output used to generate that image. When more than one such inverse mappings exist, our inverse ma.pping is special in that it has no projection onto the nullspace of the activation flow opera tor for the entire network. An important by-product of our calculation, when more than one invel'se mappings exist, is an orthogonal basis set of a significant portion of the activation flow operator nullspace. This basis set can be used to obtain an alternate inverse mapping that is optimized for a particular rea.l-world application. 1 Overview This paper describes a closed-form technique for mapping a particular output of a trained backpropagation net.work int.o input activity space.

Dynamics of Generalization in Linear Perceptrons,"We study the evolution of the generalization ability of a simple linear per ceptron with N inputs which learns to imitate a ""teacher perceptron"". The system is trained on p = aN binary example inputs and the generaliza tion ability measured by testing for agreement with the teacher on all 2N possible binary input patterns. The dynamics may be solved analytically and exhibits a phase transition from imperfect to perfect generalization at a = 1. Except at this point the generalization ability approaches its asymptotic value exponentially, with critical slowing down near the tran sition; the relaxation time is ex (1 - y'a)-2. Right at the critical point, 1 the approach to perfect generalization follows a power law ex t -'2.

Translating Locative Prepositions,"A network was trained by back propagation to map locative expressions of the form ""noun-preposition-noun"" to a semantic representation, as in Cosic and Munro (1988). The network's performance was analyzed over several simulations with training sets in both English and German. Translation of prepositions was attempted by presenting a locative expression to a network trained in one language to generate a semantic representation; the semantic representation was then presented to the network trained in the other language to generate the appropriate preposition. 1 INTRODUCTION Connectionist approaches have enjoyed success, relative to competing frameworks, in accounting for context sensitivity and have become an attractive approach to NLP.

ADAPTIVE SPLINE NETWORKS,"A network based on splines is described. It automatically adapts the num ber of units, unit parameters, and the architecture of the network for each application. 1 INTRODUCTION In supervised learning one has a system under study that responds to a set of simultaneous input signals {Xl'"" xn }. The response is characterized by a set of output signals {Y1, Y2,""', Ym}. The goal is to learn the relationship between the inputs and the outputs. This exercise generally has two purposes: prediction and understanding. With prediction one is given a set of input values and wishes to predict or forecast likely values of the corresponding outputs without having to actually run the system. Sometimes prediction is the only purpose. Often, however, one wishes to use the derived relationship to gain understanding of how the system works. Such knowledge is often useful in its own right, for example in science, or it may be used to help improve the characteristics of the system, as in industrial or engin",Optimization & Theoretical ML,0d0fd7c6e093f7b804fa0150b875b868-Paper.pdf,1990
An Analog VLSI Chip for Finding Edges,"We have designed and tested a one-dimensional 64 pixel, analog CMOS VLSI chip which localizes intensity edges in real-time. This device exploits on-chip photoreceptors and the natural filtering properties of resistive net works to implement a scheme similar to and motivated by the Difference of Gaussians (DOG) operator proposed by Marr and Hildreth (1980). Our chip computes the zero-crossings associated with the difference of two ex ponential weighting functions. If the derivative across this zero-crossing is above a threshold, an edge is reported. Simulations indicate that this technique will extend well to two dimensions. 1 INTRODUCTION The zero-crossings of the Laplacian of the Gaussian,V2G, are often used for detect ing edges.

"Comparison of three classification techniques,","In this paper, after some introductory remarks into the classification prob lem as considered in various research communities, and some discussions concerning some of the reasons for ascertaining the performances of the three chosen algorithms, viz., CART (Classification and Regression Tree), C4.5 (one of the more recent versions of a popular induction tree tech nique known as ID3), and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), it is proposed to compare the performances of these algorithms under two criteria: classi fication and generalisation. It is found that, in general, the MLP has better classification and generalisation accuracies compared with the other two algorithms. 1 Introduction Classification of data into categories has been pursued by a number of research communities, viz., applied statistics, knowledge acquisition, neural networks.

dynamic processes,"The goal has been to construct a supervised artificial neural network that learns incrementally an unknown mapping. As a result a network con sisting of a combination of ART2 and backpropagation is proposed and is called an ""ART2/BP"" network. The ART2 network is used to build and focus a supervised backpropagation network. The ART2/BP network has the advantage of being able to dynamically expand itself in response to input patterns containing new information. Simulation results show that the ART2/BP network outperforms a classical maximum likelihood method for the estimation of a discrete dynamic and nonlinear transfer function. 1 INTRODUCTION Most current neural network architectures such as backpropagation require a cyclic presentation of the entire training set to converge. They are thus not very well suited for adaptive estimation tasks where the training vectors arrive one by one, and where the network may never see the same training vector twice.

Self-organization of Hebbian Synapses,"We are exploring the significance of biological complexity for neuronal computation. Here we demonstrate that Hebbian synapses in realistical ly-modeled hippocampal pyramidal cells may give rise to two novel forms of self- organization in response to structured synaptic input. First, on the basis of the electrotonic relationships between synaptic contacts, a cell may become tuned to a small subset of its input space. Second, the same mechanisms may produce clusters of potentiated synapses across the space of the dendrites. The latter type of self-organization may be functionally significant in the presence of nonlinear dendritic conduc tances. 1 INTRODUCTION Long-term potentiation (LT P) is an experimentally observed form of synaptic plasticity that has been interpreted as an instance of a Hebbian modification (Kelso et al, 1986; Brown et al, 1990).

For various network topologies, we calculate the critical time delay for the onset of oscillation in continuous-time networks and present analytic phase diagrams characterizing the dynamics of discrete-time networks. 1 INTRODUCTION Mutual inhibition in an array of neurons is a common feature of sensory systems including vision, olfaction, and audition in organisms ranging from invertebrates to man. A well-studied instance of this configuration is lateral inhibition between neighboring photosensitive neurons in the retina (Dowling, 1987).

REMARKS ON INTERPOLATION AND,"We consider different types of single-hidden-Iayer feedforward nets: with or without direct input to output connections, and using either thresh old or sigmoidal activation functions.

It is a fundamental requirement to com pute the gradient of this energy function with respect to the various pa rameters of the neural architecture, e.g., synaptic weights, neural gain,etc. In principle, this requires solving a system of nonlinear equations for each parameter of the model, which is computationally very expensive.

Studying these networks from the perspective of dynamical systems yields two interesting discoveries: First, a longitudinal examination of the learning process illustrates a new form of mechanical inference: Induction by phase transition. A small weight adjustment causes a ""bifurcation"" in the limit behavior of the network. This phase transition corresponds to the onset of the network's capacity for generalizing to arbitrary-length strings. Second, a study of the automata resulting from the acquisition of previously published languages indicates that while the architecture is NOT guaranteed to find a minimal finite automata consistent with the given exemplars, which is an NP-Hard problem, the architecture does appear capable of generating non regular languages by exploiting fractal and chaotic dynamics.

Chaitin-Kolmogorov Complexity,"We present a unified framework for a number of different ways of failing to generalize properly. During learning, sources of random information contaminate the network, effectively augmenting the training data with random information. The complexity of the function computed is therefore increased, and generalization is degraded. We analyze replicated networks, in which a number of identical networks are independently trained on the same data and their results averaged. We conclude that replication almost always results in a decrease in the expected complexity of the network, and that replication therefore increases expected generalization.

The model clarifies how preprocessing of motion signals by a Motion Oriented Contrast Filter (MOC Filter) is joined to long-range co operative motion mechanisms in a motion Cooperative Competitive Loop (CC Loop) to control phenomena such as as induced motion, motion cap ture, and motion aftereffects. The total model system is a motion Bound ary Contour System (BCS) that is computed in parallel with a static BCS before both systems cooperate to generate a boundary representation for three dimensional visual form perception. The present investigations clari fy how the static BCS can be modified for use in motion segmentation prob lems, notably for analyzing how ambiguous local movements (the aperture problem) on a complex moving shape are suppressed and actively reorga nized into a coherent global motion signal. 1 INTRODUCTION: WHY ARE STATIC AND MOTION BOUNDARY CONTOUR SYSTEMS NEEDED?

Exploratory Feature Extraction in Speech Signals,"A novel unsupervised neural network for dimensionality reduction which seeks directions emphasizing multimodality is presented, and its connec tion to exploratory projection pursuit methods is discussed. This leads to a new statistical insight to the synaptic modification equations governing learning in Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) neurons (1982). The importance of a dimensionality reduction principle based solely on distinguishing features, is demonstrated using a linguistically motivated phoneme recognition experiment, and compared with feature extraction using back-propagation network. 1 Introduction Due to the curse of dimensionality (Bellman, 1961) it is desirable to extract fea tures from a high dimensional data space before attempting a classification. How to perform this feature extraction/dimensionality reduction is not that clear. A first simplification is to consider only features defined by linear (or semi-linear) projec tions of high dimensional data. This class of",NLP,320722549d1751cf3f247855f937b982-Paper.pdf,1990
Constructing Hidden Units,"While the network loading problem for 2-layer threshold nets is NP-hard when learning from examples alone (as with backpropaga tion), (Baum, 91) has now proved that a learner can employ queries to evade the hidden unit credit assignment problem and PAC-load nets with up to four hidden units in polynomial time. Empirical tests show that the method can also learn far more complicated functions such as randomly generated networks with 200 hidden units. The algorithm easily approximates Wieland's 2-spirals func tion using a single layer of 50 hidden units, and requires only 30 minutes of CPU time to learn 200-bit parity to 99.7% accuracy. 1 Introd uction Recent theoretical results (Baum & Haussler, 89) promise good generalization from multi-layer feedforward nets that are consistent with sufficiently large training sets. Unfortunately, the problem of finding such a net has been proved intractable due to the hidden unit credit assignment problem - even for nets containing only 2 hidden unit",Optimization & Theoretical ML,34ed066df378efacc9b924ec161e7639-Paper.pdf,1990
Analog Neural Networks as Decoders,"Analog neural networks with feedback can be used to implement l( Winner-Take-All (KWTA) networks. In turn, KWTA networks can be used as decoders of a class of nonlinear error-correcting codes. By in terconnecting such KWTA networks, we can construct decoders capable of decoding more powerful codes. We consider several families of inter connected KWTA networks, analyze their performance in terms of coding theory metrics, and consider the feasibility of embedding such networks in VLSI technologies. 1 INTRODUCTION: THE K-WINNER-TAKE-ALL NETWORK We have previously demonstrated the use of a continuous Hopfield neural network as a K-Winner-Take-All (KWTA) network [Majani et al., 1989, Erlanson and Abu Mostafa, 1988}.

A Reinforcement Learning Variant for Control,"We present an algorithm based on reinforcement and state recurrence learning techniques to solve control scheduling problems. In particular, we have devised a simple learning scheme called ""handicapped learning"", in which the weights of the associative search element are reinforced, either positively or negatively, such that the system is forced to move towards the desired setpoint in the shortest possible trajectory. To improve the learning rate, a variable reinforcement scheme is employed: negative reinforcement values are varied depending on whether the failure occurs in handicapped or normal mode of operation. Furthermore, to realize a simulated annealing scheme for accelerated learning, if the system visits the same failed state successively, the negative reinforcement value is increased. In examples studied, these learning schemes have demonstrated high learning rates, and therefore may prove useful for in-situ learning. 1 INTRODUCTION Reinforcement learning techniques have been ",Reinforcement Learning,357a6fdf7642bf815a88822c447d9dc4-Paper.pdf,1990
Kohonen Networks and Clustering: Comparative,"The problem of color clustering is defined and shown to be a problem of assigning a large number (hundreds of thousands) of 3-vectors to a small number (256) of clusters. Finding those clusters in such a way that they best represent a full color image using only 256 distinct colors is a burdensome computational problem. In this paper, the problem is solved using ""classical"" techniques --k-means clustering, vector quantization (which turns out to be the same thing in this application), competitive learning, and Kohonen self-organizing feature maps. Quality of the result is judged subjectively by how much the pseudo-color result resembles the true color image, by RMS quantization error, and by run time. The Kohonen map provides the best solution. 1 INTRODUCTION ""Clusteringn, ""vector quantization"", and ""unsupervised learning"" are all words which descn'be the same process: assigning a few exemplars to represent a large set of samples.

Connections,"We describe a CMOS neural net chip with a reconfigurable network archi tecture. It contains 32,768 binary, programmable connections arranged in 256 'building block' neurons. Several 'building blocks' can be connected to form long neurons with up to 1024 binary connections or to form neurons with analog connections. Single- or multi-layer networks can be imple mented with this chip. We have integrated this chip into a board system together with a digital signal processor and fast memory. This system is currently in use for image processing applications in which the chip extracts features such as edges and corners from binary and gray-level images. 1 INTRODUCTION A key problem for a hardware implementation of neural nets is to find the proper network architecture.

Extensions of a Theory of Networks for,"Learning an input-output mapping from a set of examples can be regarded as synthesizing an approximation of a multi-dimensional function.

Stochastic Neurodynamics,"The main point of this paper is that stochastic neural networks have a mathematical structure that corresponds quite closely with that of quantum field theory. Neural network Liouvillians and Lagrangians can be derived, just as can spin Hamiltonians and Lagrangians in QFf. It remains to show the efficacy of such a description. 1 INTRODUCTION A basic problem in the analysis of large-scale neural network activity, is that one can never know the initial state of such activity, nor can one safely assume that synaptic weights are symmetric, or skew-symmetric. How can one proceed, therefore, to analyse such activity? One answer is to use a ""Master Equation"" (Van Kampen, 1981). In principle this can provide statistical information, moments and correlation functions of network activity by making use of ensemble averaging over all possible initial states. In what follows I give a short account of such an approach. 1.1 THE BASIC NEURAL MODEL In this approach neurons are represented as simple gat",Optimization & Theoretical ML,3c7781a36bcd6cf08c11a970fbe0e2a6-Paper.pdf,1990
Phonetic Classification and Recognition,"In this paper, we will describe several extensions to our earlier work, utiliz ing a segment-based approach. We will formulate our segmental framework and report our study on the use of multi-layer perceptrons for detection and classification of phonemes. We will also examine the outputs of the network, and compare the network performance with other classifiers. Our investigation is performed within a set of experiments that attempts to recognize 38 vowels and consonants in American English independent of speaker. When evaluated on the TIMIT database, our system achieves an accuracy of 56%. 1 Introduction Thus far, the neural networks research community has placed heavy emphasis on the problem of pattern classification.

Learning Trajectory and Force Control,"We propose a new parallel-hierarchical neural network model to enable motor learning for simultaneous control of both trajectory and force. by integrating Hogan's control method and our previous neural network control model using a feedback-error-learning scheme. Furthermore. two hierarchical control laws which apply to the model, are derived by using the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse matrix. One is related to the minimum muscle-tension-change trajectory and the other is related to the minimum motor-command-change trajectory. The human arm is redundant at the dynamics level since joint torque is generated by agonist and antagonist muscles. Therefore, acquisition of the inverse model is an ill-posed problem. However. the combination of these control laws and feedback-error-learning resolve the ill-posed problem. Finally. the efficiency of the parallel-hierarchical neural network model is shown by learning experiments using an artificial muscle arm and computer simulations. 1 INTRODUCTION",Reinforcement Learning,3fe94a002317b5f9259f82690aeea4cd-Paper.pdf,1990
Basis-Function Trees as a Generalization of Local,"Local variable selection has proven to be a powerful technique for ap proximating functions in high-dimensional spaces. It is used in several statistical methods, including CART, ID3, C4, MARS, and others (see the bibliography for references to these algorithms). In this paper I present a tree-structured network which is a generalization of these techniques. The network provides a framework for understanding the behavior of such algorithms and for modifying them to suit particular applications. 1 INTRODUCTION Function approximation on high-dimensional spaces is often thwarted by a lack of sufficient data to adequately ""fill"" the space, or lack of sufficient computational resources. The technique of local variable selection provides a partial solution to these problems by attempting to approximate functions locally using fewer than the complete set of input dimensions.

A Short-Term Memory Architecture for the,"Despite its successes, Rumelhart and McClelland's (1986) well-known ap proach to the learning of morphophonemic rules suffers from two deficien cies: (1) It performs the artificial task of associating forms with forms rather than perception or production. (2) It is not constrained in ways that humans learners are. This paper describes a model which addresses both objections. Using a simple recurrent architecture which takes both forms and ""meanings"" as inputs, the model learns to generate verbs in one or another ""tense"", given arbitrary meanings, and to recognize the tenses of verbs. Furthermore, it fails to learn reversal processes unknown in human language. 1 BACKGROUND In the debate over the power of connectionist models to handle linguistic phenom ena, considerable attention has been focused on the learning of simple morphological rules. It is a straightforward matter in a symbolic system to specify how the mean ings of a stem and a bound morpheme combine to yield the meaning of a ",NLP,41ae36ecb9b3eee609d05b90c14222fb-Paper.pdf,1990
Associative Memory in a Network of 'biological',"The Hopfield network (Hopfield, 1982,1984) provides a simple model of an associative memory in a neuronal structure. This model, however, is based on highly artificial assumptions, especially the use of formal-two state neu rons (Hopfield, 1982) or graded-response neurons (Hopfield, 1984). \Vhat happens if we replace the formal neurons by 'real' biological neurons? \Ve address this question in two steps. First, we show that a simple model of a neuron can capture all relevant features of neuron spiking, i. e., a wide range of spiking frequencies and a realistic distribution of interspike inter vals. Second, we construct an associative memory by linking these neurons together. The analytical solution for a large and fully connected network shows that the Hopfield solution is valid only for neurons with a short re fractory period. If the refractory period is longer than a crit.ical duration ie, the solutions are qualitatively different.

Oriented Non-Radial Basis Functions for Image,"We introduce oriented non-radial basis function networks (ONRBF) as a generalization of Radial Basis Function networks (RBF)- wherein the Euclidean distance metric in the exponent of the Gaussian is re placed by a more general polynomial. This permits the definition of more general regions and in particular- hyper-ellipses with orienta tions. In the case of hyper-surface estimation this scheme requires a smaller number of hidden units and alleviates the ""curse of dimen sionality"" associated kernel type approximators.In the case of an im age, the hidden units correspond to features in the image and the parameters associated with each unit correspond to the rotation, scal ing and translation properties of that particular ""feature"". In the con text of the ONBF scheme, this means that an image can be represented by a small number of features. Since, transformation of an image by rotation, scaling and translation correspond to identical transformations of the individual features, the ONBF s",Computer Vision,42e7aaa88b48137a16a1acd04ed91125-Paper.pdf,1990
Evaluation of Adaptive Mixtures,"We compare the performance of the modular architecture, composed of competing expert networks, suggested by Jacobs, Jordan, Nowlan and Hinton (1991) to the performance of a single back-propagation network on a complex, but low-dimensional, vowel recognition task. Simulations reveal that this system is capable of uncovering interesting decompositions in a complex task. The type of decomposition is strongly influenced by the nature of the input to the gating network that decides which expert to use for each case. The modular architecture also exhibits consistently better generalization on many variations of the task. 1 Introduction If back-propagation is used to train a single, multilayer network to perform different subtasks on different occasions, there will generally be strong interference effects which lead to slow learning and poor generalization.

Design and Implementation of a High Speed,"A high speed implementation of the CMAC neural network was designed using dedicated CMOS logic. This technology was then used to implement two general purpose CMAC associative memory boards for the VME bus. Each board implements up to 8 independent CMAC networks with a total of one million adjustable weights. Each CMAC network can be configured to have from 1 to 512 integer inputs and from 1 to 8 integer outputs. Response times for typical CMAC networks are well below 1 millisecond, making the networks sufficiently fast for most robot control problems, and many pattern recognition and signal processing problems. 1 INTRODUCTION We have been investigating learning techniques for the control of robotic manipu lators which utilize extensions of the CMAC neural network as developed by Albus 1022 Design and Implementation of a High Speed CMAC Neural Network 1023 (1972; 1975; 1979).

Spoken Letter Recognition,"Through the use of neural network classifiers and careful feature selection, we have achieved high-accuracy speaker-independent spoken letter recog nition. For isolated letters, a broad-category segmentation is performed Location of segment boundaries allows us to measure features at specific locations in the signal such as vowel onset, where important information resides. Letter classification is performed with a feed-forward neural net work. Recognition accuracy on a test set of 30 speakers was 96%. Neu ral network classifiers are also used for pitch tracking and broad-category segmentation of letter strings. Our research has been extended to recog nition of names spelled with pauses between the letters. When searching a database of 50,000 names, we achieved 95% first choice name retrieval.

Shaping the State Space Landscape in Recurrent,"Fully recurrent (asymmetrical) networks can be thought of as dynamic systems. The dynamics can be shaped to perform content addressable memories, recognize sequences, or generate trajectories. Unfortunately several problems can arise: First, the convergence in the state space is not guaranteed. Second, the learned fixed points or trajectories are not necessarily stable. Finally, there might exist spurious fixed points and/or spurious ""attracting"" trajectories that do not correspond to any patterns. In this paper, we introduce a new energy function that presents solutions to all of these problems. We present an efficient gradient descent algorithm which directly acts on the stability of the fixed points and trajectories and on the size and shape of the corresponding basin and valley of attraction.

"INTERACTION AMONG OCULARITY,","The development of projections from the retinas to the cortex is mathematically analyzed according to the previously proposed thermodynamic formulation of the self-organization of neural networks. Three types of submodality included in the visual afferent pathways are assumed in two models: model (A), in which the ocularity and retinotopy are considered separately, and model (B), in which on-center/off-center pathways are considered in addition to ocularity and retinotopy. Model (A) shows striped ocular dominance spatial patterns and, in ocular dominance histograms, reveals a dip in the binocular bin. Model (B) displays spatially modulated irregular patterns and shows single-peak behavior in the histograms.

An interesting, and as of yet, nearly untapped set of applications for VLSI imple mentation of neural network learning systems can be found in adaptive control and non-linear signal processing. In most such applications, the learning task consists of approximating a real function of a small number of continuous variables from discrete data points.

Qualitative structure from motion,"Exact structure from motion is an ill-posed computation and therefore very sensitive to noise. In this work I describe how a qualitative shape representation, based on the sign of the Gaussian curvature, can be com puted directly from motion disparities, without the computation of an exact depth map or the directions of surface normals. I show that humans can judge the curvature sense of three points undergoing 3D motion from two, three and four views with success rate significantly above chance. A simple RBF net has been trained to perform the same task. 1 INTRODUCTION When a scene is recorded from two or more different positions in space, e.g. by a moving camera, objects are projected into disparate locations in each image. This disparity can be used to recover the three-dimensional structure of objects that is lost in the projection process. The computation of structure requires knowledge of the 3D motion parameters.

Two neural network (radial basis function and high order polynomial GMDH network) and five conventional classifiers (Gaussian mixture, linear tree, K nearest neighbor, KD-tree, and condensed K nearest neighbor) were evaluated. Classifiers were chosen to be representative of different approaches to pat tern classification and to complement and extend those evaluated in a previous study (Lee and Lippmann, 1989). This and the previous study both demonstrate that classification error rates can be equivalent across different classifiers when they are powerful enough to form minimum er ror decision regions, when they are properly tuned, and when sufficient training data is available.

Generalization Properties of Radial Basis,"We examine the ability of radial basis functions (RBFs) to generalize. We compare the performance of several types of RBFs. We use the inverse dy namics of an idealized two-joint arm as a test case. We find that without a proper choice of a norm for the inputs, RBFs have poor generalization properties. A simple global scaling of the input variables greatly improves performance.

Given this framework and focusing on memory-based algorithms, we have derived some PAC-style sample complexity results that determine, for example, when tracking is feasible. We have also used a similar framework and focused on incremental tracking algorithms for which we have derived some bounds on the mistake or error rates for some specific concept classes. 1 INTRODUCTION The goal of our ongoing research is to extend computational learning theory to include concepts that can change or evolve over time. For example, face recognition is complicat ed by the fact that a persons face changes slowly with age and more quickly with changes in make up, hairstyle, or facial hair.

A Theory for Neural Networks with Time Delays,"We present a new neural network model for processing of temporal patterns. This model, the gamma neural model, is as general as a convolution delay model with arbitrary weight kernels w(t). We show that the gamma model can be formulated as a (partially prewired) additive model. A temporal hebbian learning rule is derived and we establish links to related existing models for temporal processing. 1 INTRODUCTION In this paper, we are concerned with developing neural nets with short term memory for processing of temporal patterns. In the literature, basically two ways have been reported to incorporate short-term memory in the neural system equations. The first approach utilizes reverberating (self-recurrent) units of type : = - aa (x) + e, that hold a trace of the past neural net states x(t) or the input e(t). Elman (1988) and Jordan (1986) have successfully used this approach. The disadvantage of this method is the lack of weighting flexibility in the temporal domain, since the system equ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,6c524f9d5d7027454a783c841250ba71-Paper.pdf,1990
Compact EEPROM-based Weight Functions,"We are focusing on the development of a highly compact neural net weight function based on the use of EEPROM devices. These devices have already proven useful for analog weight storage, but existing designs rely on the use of conventional voltage multiplication as the weight function, requiring additional transistors per synapse. A parasitic capacitance between the floating gate and the drain of the EEPROM structure leads to an unusual J-V characteristic which can be used to advantage in designing a compact synapse. This novel behavior is well characterized by a model we have developed. A single-device circuit results in a 1-quadrant synapse function which is nonlinear, though monotonic. A simple extension employing 2 EEPROMs results in a 2 quadrant function which is much more linear. This approach offers the potential for more than a ten-fold increase in the density of neural net implementations. 1 INTRODUCTION - ANALOG WEIGHTING The recent surge of interest in neural networks and par",Optimization & Theoretical ML,6ecbdd6ec859d284dc13885a37ce8d81-Paper.pdf,1990

The dolphin recognizes targets by emitting natural sonar signals and listening to the echoes that return. This paper describes a novel neural network architecture, called an integrator gateway network, that we have de veloped to account for this performance. The integrator gateway network combines information from multiple echoes to classify targets with about 90% accuracy.

Discovering Viewpoint-Invariant Relationships,"Using an unsupervised learning procedure, a network is trained on an en semble of images of the same two-dimensional object at different positions, orientations and sizes. Each half of the network ""sees"" one fragment of the object, and tries to produce as output a set of 4 parameters that have high mutual information with the 4 parameters output by the other half of the network. Given the ensemble of training patterns, the 4 parameters on which the two halves of the network can agree are the position, orientation, and size of the whole object, or some recoding of them. After training, the network can reject instances of other shapes by using the fact that the predictions made by its two halves disagree. If two competing networks are trained on an unlabelled mixture of images of two objects, they cluster the training cases on the basis of the objects' shapes, independently of the position, orientation, and size. 1 INTRODUCTION A difficult problem for neural networks is to recognize obje",Computer Vision,6faa8040da20ef399b63a72d0e4ab575-Paper.pdf,1990

On-line learning based on system realization. 3. Vector valued adaptive critics. An algorithm is described which is based on system realization and on two interacting fully recurrent continually running net works which may learn in parallel. Problems with parallel learning are attacked by 'adaptive randomness'. It is also described how interacting model/controller systems can be combined with vector-valued 'adaptive critics' (previous critics have been scalar). 1 INTRODUCTION At a given time, an agent with a non-Markovian interface to its environment cannot derive an optimal next action by considering its current input only. The algorithm described below differs from previous reinforcement algorithms in at least some of the following issues: It has a potential for on-line learning and non-Markovian environments, it is local in time",Reinforcement Learning,70c639df5e30bdee440e4cdf599fec2b-Paper.pdf,1990
Second Order Properties of Error Surfaces :,"The learning time of a simple neural network model is obtained through an analytic computation of the eigenvalue spectrum for the Hessian matrix, which describes the second order properties of the cost function in the space of coupling coefficients.

The dynamical properties of searches based on gradient descent are controlled by the second order properties of the E(W) surface.

CONCERT is an extension of a traditional algorithmic composition tech nique in which transition tables specify the probability of the next note as a function of previous context. A central ingredient of CONCERT is the use of a psychologically-grounded representation of pitch. 1 INTRODUCTION In creating music, composers bring to bear a wealth of knowledge about musical conven tions. If we hope to build automatic music composition systems that can mimic the abili ties of human composers, it will be necessary to incorporate knowledge about musical conventions into the systems. However, this knowledge is difficult to express: even hu man composers are unaware of many of the constraints under which they operate.

Transforming Neural-Net Output Levels,"(1) The outputs of a typical multi-output classification network do not satisfy the axioms of probability; probabilities should be positive and sum to one. This problem can be solved by treating the trained network as a preprocessor that produces a feature vector that can be further processed, for instance by classical statistical estimation techniques. (2) We present a method for computing the first two moments ofthe probability distribution indicating the range of outputs that are consistent with the input and the training data. It is particularly useful to combine these two ideas: we implement the ideas of section 1 using Parzen windows, where the shape and relative size of each window is computed using the ideas of section 2. This allows us to make contact between important theoretical ideas (e.g. the ensemble formalism) and practical techniques (e.g. back-prop).

Discovering Discrete Distributed Representations,"Competitive learning is an unsupervised algorithm that classifies input pat terns into mutually exclusive clusters. In a neural net framework, each clus ter is represented by a processing unit that competes with others in a winner take-all pool for an input pattern. I present a simple extension to the algo rithm that allows it to construct discrete, distributed representations. Discrete representations are useful because they are relatively easy to analyze and their information content can readily be measured. Distributed representa tions are useful because they explicitly encode similarity. The basic idea is to apply competitive learning iteratively to an input pattern, and after each stage to subtract from the input pattern the component that was captured in the representation at that stage. This component is simply the weight vector of the winning unit of the competitive pool. The subtraction procedure forces competitive pools at different stages to encode different aspects of the i",Deep Learning,819f46e52c25763a55cc642422644317-Paper.pdf,1990

Learning by Combining Memorization,"We have created a radial basis function network that allocates a new computational unit whenever an unusual pattern is presented to the network. The network learns by allocating new units and adjusting the parameters of existing units. If the network performs poorly on a presented pattern, then a new unit is allocated which memorizes the response to the presented pattern. If the network performs well on a presented pattern, then the network parameters are updated using standard LMS gradient descent. For predicting the Mackey Glass chaotic time series, our network learns much faster than do those using back-propagation and uses a comparable number of synapses. 1 INTRODUCTION Currently, networks that perform function interpolation tend to fall into one of two categories: networks that use gradient descent for learning (e.g., back-propagation), and constructive networks that use memorization for learning (e.g., k-nearest neigh bors).

Can neural networks do better than the,"\Ve describe a series of careful llumerical experiments which measure the average generalization capability of neural networks trained on a variety of simple functions. These experiments are designed to test whether average generalization performance can surpass the worst-case bounds obtained from formal learning theory using the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension (Blumer et al., 1989). We indeed find that, in some cases, the average generalization is significantly better than the VC bound: the approach to perfect performance is exponential in the number of examples m, rather than the 11m result of the bound. In other cases, we do find the 11m behavior of the VC bound, and in these cases, the numerical prefactor is closely related to prefactor contained in the bound. 1 INTRODUCTION Probably the most important issue in the study of supervised learning procedures is the issue of generalization, i.e., how well the learning system can perform on inputs not seen during training.

Distributed Recursive Structure Processing,"Harmonic grammar (Legendre, et al., 1990) is a connectionist theory of lin guistic well-formed ness based on the assumption that the well-formedness of a sentence can be measured by the harmony (negative energy) of the corresponding connectionist state. Assuming a lower-level connectionist network that obeys a few general connectionist principles but is otherwise unspecified, we construct a higher-level network with an equivalent har mony function that captures the most linguistically relevant global aspects of the lower level network. In this paper, we extend the tensor product representation (Smolensky 1990) to fully recursive representations of re cursively structured objects like sentences in the lower-level network.

This allows novel spline network architectures to be developed that can combine the generalization capabilities and scaling properties of global multi-layer feedforward networks with the computational efficiency and learning speed of local computational paradigms.

Planning with an Adaptive World Model,"We present a new connectionist planning method [TML90]. By interaction with an unknown environment, a world model is progressively construc ted using gradient descent. For deriving optimal actions with respect to future reinforcement, planning is applied in two steps: an experience net work proposes a plan which is subsequently optimized by gradient descent with a chain of world models, so that an optimal reinforcement may be obtained when it is actually run. The appropriateness of this method is demonstrated by a robotics application and a pole balancing task. 1 INTRODUCTION Whenever decisions are to be made with respect to some events in the future, planning has been proved to be an important and powerful concept in problem solving. Planning is applicable if an autonomous agent interacts with a world, and if a reinforcement is available which measures only the over-all performance of the agent.

Statistical Mechanics of Temporal Association,"We study the representation of static patterns and temporal associa tions in neural networks with a broad distribution of signal delays. For a certain class of such systems, a simple intuitive understanding of the spatia-temporal computation becomes possible with the help of a novel Lyapunov functional. It allows a quantitative study of the asymptotic network behavior through a statistical mechanical analysis. We present analytic calculations of both retrieval quality and storage capacity and compare them with simulation results. 1 INTRODUCTION Basic computational functions of associative neural structures may be analytically studied within the framework of attractor neural networks where static patterns are stored as stable fixed-points for the system's dynamics. If the interactions between single neurons are instantaneous and mediated by symmetric couplings, there is a Lyapunov function for the retrieval dynamics (Hopfield 1982).

Cholinergic Modulation May Enhance Cortical,"Combining neuropharmacological experiments with computational model ing, we have shown that cholinergic modulation may enhance associative memory function in piriform (olfactory) cortex. We have shown that the acetylcholine analogue carbachol selectively suppresses synaptic transmis sion between cells within piriform cortex, while leaving input connections unaffected. When tested in a computational model of piriform cortex, this selective suppression, applied during learning, enhances associative memory performance. 1 INTRODUCTION A wide range of behavioral studies support a role for the neurotransmitter acetyl choline in memory function (Kopelman, 1986; Hagan and Morris, 1989). However, the role of acetylcholine in memory function has not been linked to the specific neuropharmacological effects of this transmitter within cerebral cortical networks.

EVOLUTION AND LEARNING IN,"Learning can increase the rate of evolution of a population of biological organisms (the Baldwin effect). Our simulations show that in a population of artificial neural networks solving a pattern recognition problem, no learning or too much learning leads to slow evolution of the genes whereas an intermediate amount is optimal. Moreover, for a given total number of training presentations, fastest evoution occurs if different individuals within each generation receive different numbers of presentations, rather than equal numbers. Because genetic algorithms (GAs) help avoid local minima in energy functions, our hybrid learning-GA systems can be applied successfully to complex, high dimensional pattern recognition problems.

A Lagrangian Approach to Fixed Points,"We present a new way to derive dissipative, optimizing dynamics from the Lagrangian formulation of mechanics. It can be used to obtain both standard and novel neural net dynamics for optimization problems. To demonstrate this we derive standard descent dynamics as well as nonstan dard variants that introduce a computational attention mechanism. 1 INTRODUCTION Neural nets are often designed to optimize some objective function E of the current state of the system via a dissipative dynamical system that has a circuit-like imple mentation. The fixed points of such a system are locally optimal in E. In physics the preferred formulation for many dynamical derivations and calculations is by means of an objective function which is an integral over time of a ""Lagrangian"" function, L. From Lagrangians one usually derives time-reversable, non-dissipative dynamics which cannot converge to a fixed point, but we present a new way to circumvent this limitation and derive optimizing neural net dynamic",Optimization & Theoretical ML,b7b16ecf8ca53723593894116071700c-Paper.pdf,1990

Computing with Arrays of Bell-Shaped and,"We consider feed-forward neural networks with one non-linear hidden layer and linear output units. The transfer function in the hidden layer are ei ther bell-shaped or sigmoid. In the bell-shaped case, we show how Bern stein polynomials on one hand and the theory of the heat equation on the other are relevant for understanding the properties of the corresponding networks. In particular, these techniques yield simple proofs of universal approximation properties, i.e. of the fact that any reasonable function can be approximated to any degree of precision by a linear combination of bell shaped functions. In addition, in this framework the problem of learning is equivalent to the problem of reversing the time course of a diffusion pro cess. The results obtained in the bell-shaped case can then be applied to the case of sigmoid transfer functions in the hidden layer, yielding similar universality results.

VLSI Implementation of TInMANN,"A massively parallel, all-digital, stochastic architecture - TlnMAN N - is described which performs competitive and Kohonen types of learning. A VLSI design is shown for a TlnMANN neuron which fits within a small, inexpensive MOSIS TinyChip frame, yet which can be used to build larger networks of several hundred neurons.

SEXNET: A NEURAL NETWORK,"Sex identification in animals has biological importance. Humans are good at making this determination visually, but machines have not matched this ability. A neural network was trained to discriminate sex in human faces, and performed as well as humans on a set of 90 exemplars. Images sampled at 30x30 were compressed using a 900x40x900 fully-connected back-propagation network; activities of hidden units served as input to a back-propagation ""SexNet"" trained to produce values of 1 for male and o for female faces.

Generalization by Weight-Elimination,"Inspired by the information theoretic idea of minimum description length, we add a term to the back propagation cost function that penalizes network complexity. We give the details of the procedure, called weight-elimination, describe its dynamics, and clarify the meaning of the parameters involved. From a Bayesian perspective, the complexity term can be usefully interpreted as an assumption about prior distribution of the weights. We use this procedure to predict the sunspot time series and the notoriously noisy series of currency exchange rates. 1 INTRODUCTION Learning procedures for connectionist networks are essentially statistical devices for per forming inductive inference. There is a trade-off between two goals: on the one hand, we want such devices to be as general as possible so that they are able to learn a broad range of problems.

A Novel Approach to Prediction of the,"Three-dimensional (3D) structures of protein backbones have been pre dicted using neural networks. A feed forward neural network was trained on a class of functionally, but not structurally, homologous proteins, us ing backpropagation learning.

To extract the signal embedded in the interspike intervals of firing, the encoded signal are de multiplexed and multiplexed by a network of neurons with delayed-line circuitry for signal processing. The temporally coded input signal is transformed spatially by mapping the firing intervals topographically to the output of the network, thus decoding the specific firing inters pike-intervals.

A four neuron circuit accounts for change sensitive,"In salamander retina, the response of On-Off ganglion cells to a central flash is reduced by movement in the receptive field surround. Through computer simulation of a 2-D model which takes into account their anatomical and physiological properties, we show that interactions between four neuron types (two bipolar and two amacrine) may be responsible for the generation and lateral conductance of this change sensitive inhibition. The model shows that the four neuron circuit can account for previously observed movement sensitive reductions in ganglion cell sensitivity and allows visualization and prediction of the spatio-temporal pattern of activity in change sensitive retinal cells. 1 INTRODUCTION In the salamander retina. the response of transient (On-Off) ganglion cells to a central flash is reduced by movement in the receptive field surround (Werblin. 1972; Werblin & Copenhagen. 1974) as illustrated in Fig 1.

Exploiting Syllable Structure,"In a previous paper (Touretzky & Wheeler, 1990a) we showed how adding a clustering operation to a connectionist phonology model produced a parallel pro cessing account of certain ""iterative"" phenomena. In this paper we show how the addition of a second structuring primitive, syllabification, greatly increases the power of the model. We present examples from a non-Indo-European language that appear to require rule ordering to at least a depth of four. By adding syllab ification circuitry to structure the model's perception of the input string, we are able to handle these examples with only two derivational steps. We conclude that in phonology, derivation can be largely replaced by structuring. 1 Introduction In linguistics a grammar is an abstract formal system describing a language.

However, their recognition accuracy has been limited by the accuracy of the underlying segmentation algorithm. Con ventional, rule-based segmentation algorithms encounter difficulty if the characters are touching, broken, or noisy.

The Devil and the Network:,"Robustness is a commonly bruited property of neural networks; in particu lar, a folk theorem in neural computation asserts that neural networks-in contexts with large interconnectivity-continue to function efficiently, al beit with some degradation, in the presence of component damage or loss. A second folk theorem in such contexts asserts that dense interconnectiv ity between neural elements is a sine qua non for the efficient usage of resources. These premises are formally examined in this communication in a setting that invokes the notion of the ""devil"" 1 in the network as an agent that produces sparsity by snipping connections. 1 ON REMOVING THE FOLK FROM THE THEOREM Robustness in the presence of component damage is a property that is commonly attributed to neural networks.

Development and Spatial Structure of Cortical,"Feature selective cells in the primary visual cortex of several species are or ganized in hierarchical topographic maps of stimulus features like ""position in visual space"", ""orientation"" and"" ocular dominance"". In order to un derstand and describe their spatial structure and their development, we in vestigate a self-organizing neural network model based on the feature map algorithm. The model explains map formation as a dimension-reducing mapping from a high-dimensional feature space onto a two-dimensional lattice, such that ""similarity"" between features (or feature combinations) is translated into ""spatial proximity"" between the corresponding feature selective cells. The model is able to reproduce several aspects of the spatial structure of cortical maps in the visual cortex. 1 Introduction Cortical maps are functionally defined structures of the cortex, which are charac terized by an ordered spatial distribution of functionally specialized cells along the cortical surface.

Connectionist Implementation of a Theory of Generalization,"Empirically, generalization between a training and a test stimulus falls off in close approximation to an exponential decay function of distance between the two stimuli in the ""stimulus space"" obtained by multidimensional scaling. Math ematically, this result is derivable from the assumption that an individual takes the training stimulus to belong to a ""consequential"" region that includes that stimulus but is otherwise of unknown location, size, and shape in the stimulus space (Shepard, 1987). As the individual gains additional information about the consequential region-by finding other stimuli to be consequential or nOl-the theory predicts the shape of the generalization function to change toward the function relating actual probability of the consequence to location in the stimulus space.

Discrete Affine Wavelet Transforms For Analysis,"In this paper we show that discrete affine wavelet transforms can provide a tool for the analysis and synthesis of standard feedforward neural net works. It is shown that wavelet frames for L2(IR) can be constructed based upon sigmoids. The spatia-spectral localization property of wavelets can be exploited in defining the topology and determining the weights of a feedforward network. Training a network constructed using the synthe sis procedure described here involves minimization of a convex cost func tional and therefore avoids pitfalls inherent in standard backpropagation algorithms. Extension of these methods to L2(IRN) is also discussed. 1 INTRODUCTION Feedforward type neural network models constructed from empirical data have been found to display significant predictive power [6].

Convergence of a Neural Network Classifier,"In this paper, we prove that the vectors in the LVQ learning algorithm converge. We do this by showing that the learning algorithm performs stochastic approximation. Convergence is then obtained by identifying the appropriate conditions on the learning rate and on the underlying statistics of the classification problem. We also present a modification to the learning algorithm which we argue results in convergence of the LVQ error to the Bayesian optimal error as the appropriate parameters become large. 1 Introduction Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) originated in the neural network community and was introduced by Kohonen (Kohonen [1986]). There have been extensive simulation studies reported in the literature demonstrating the effectiveness of LVQ as a classifier and it has generated considerable interest as the training times asso ciated with LVQ are significantly less than those associated with backpropagation networks.

Optimal Sampling of Natural Images: A Design,"We formulate the problem of optimizing the sampling of natural images using an array of linear filters. Optimization of information capacity is constrained by the noise levels of the individual channels and by a penalty for the construction of long-range interconnections in the array. At low signal-to-noise ratios the optimal filter characteristics correspond to bound states of a Schrodinger equation in which the signal spectrum plays the role of the potential. The resulting optimal filters are remarkably similar to those observed in the mammalian visual cortex and the retinal ganglion cells of lower vertebrates. The observed scale invariance of natural images plays an essential role in this construction. 363 364 Bialek, Ruderman, and Zee 1 Introduction Under certain conditions the visual system is capable of performing extremely effi cient signal processing [I].

A competitive modular connectionist architecture,"We describe a multi-network, or modular, connectionist architecture that captures that fact that many tasks have structure at a level of granularity intermediate to that assumed by local and global function approximation schemes. The main innovation of the architecture is that it combines associative and competitive learning in order to learn task decompositions. A task decomposition is discovered by forcing the networks comprising the architecture to compete to learn the training patterns. As a result of the competition, different networks learn different training patterns and, thus, learn to partition the input space. The performance of the architecture on a ""what"" and ""where"" vision task and on a multi-payload robotics task are presented. 1 INTRODUCTION A dichotomy has arisen in recent years in the literature on nonlinear network learn ing rules between local approximation of functions and global approximation of functions.

A VLSI Neural Network for Color Constancy,"A system for color correction has been designed, built, and tested suc cessfully; the essential components are three custom chips built using sub threshold analog CMOS VLSI. The system, based on Land's Retinex the ory of color constancy, produces colors similar in many respects to those produced by the visual system. Resistive grids implemented in analog VLSI perform the smoothing operation central to the algorithm at video rates. With the electronic system, the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm are explored. 1 A MODEL FOR COLOR CONSTANCY Humans have the remarkable ability to perceive object colors as roughly constant even if the color of the illumination is varied widely. Edwin Land, founder of the Polaroid Corporation, models the computation that results in this ability as three identical center-surround operations performed independently in three color planes, such as red, green, and blue (Land, 1986).

Stereopsis by a Neural Network,This paper presents a neural network (NN) approach to the problem of stereopsis. The correspondence problem (finding the correct matches between the pixels of the epipolar lines of the stereo pair from amongst all the possible matches) is posed as a non-iterative many-to-one mapping. A two-layer feed forward NN architecture is developed to learn and code this nonlinear and complex mapping using the back-propagation learning rule and a training set. The important aspect of this technique is that none of the typical constraints such as uniqueness and continuity are explicitly imposed. All the applicable constraints are learned and internally coded by the NN enabling it to be more flexible and more accurate than the existing methods. The approach is successfully tested on several random dot stereograms. It is shown that the net can generalize its learned map ping to cases outside its training set.

Supervised Learning,"In this work we describe a new method that adjusts time-delays and the widths of time-windows in artificial neural networks automatically. The input of the units are weighted by a gaussian input-window over time which allows the learning rules for the delays and widths to be derived in the same way as it is used for the weights. Our results on a phoneme classification task compare well with results obtained with the TDNN by Waibel et al., which was manually optimized for the same task. 1 INTRODUCTION The processing of pattern-sequences has been investigated with several neural network architectures. One approach to processing of temporal context with neural networks is to implement time-delays.

Second we numerically examine the more realistic problem of training a competitive net to learn a probability density from samples. We find TLS useful for predicting average training behavior. . 1 TLS APPLIED TO LEARNING DENSITIES Recently a theory of learning has been constructed which describes the learning of a relation from examples (Tishby, Levin, and Sol1a, 1989), (Schwarb, Samalan, Sol1a, and Denker, 1990). The original derivation relies on a statistical mechanics treatment of the probability of independent events in a system with a specified average value of an additive error function. The resulting theory is not restricted to learning relations and it is not essentially statistical mechanical.

The Recurrent Cascade-Correlation Architecture,"Recurrent Cascade-Correlation CRCC) is a recurrent version of the Cascade Correlation learning architecture of Fah Im an and Lebiere [Fahlman, 1990]. RCC can learn from examples to map a sequence of inputs into a desired sequence of outputs. New hidden units with recurrent connections are added to the network as needed during training. In effect, the network builds up a finite-state machine tailored specifically for the current problem. RCC retains the advantages of Cascade-Correlation: fast learning, good generalization, automatic construction of a near-minimal multi-layered network, and incremental training. 1 THE ARCHITECTURE Cascade-Correlation [Fahlman, 1990] is a supervised learning architecture that builds a near-minimal multi-layer network topology in the course of training. Initially the network contains only inputs, output units, and the connections between them.

This method makes use of each observation efficiently in that the network mapping function so obtained is consistent with that information and is also optimal in the least L 2-norm sense. The RBF network with the F-Projections adaptation algorithm was used for pre dicting a chaotic time-series. We compare its performance to an adapta tion scheme based on the method of stochastic approximation, and show that the F-Projections algorithm converges to the underlying model much faster. 1 INTRODUCTION Sequential adaptation is important for signal processing applications such as time series prediction and adaptive control in nonstationary environments.

Analytical approaches to this problem have been described and they work with reasonable accuracy (Gabriel et al. 1980.

We also propose a heuristic search strategy to explore the space of possible architectures.

In contrast to this approach, we study here how the overall network activity can control single cell parameters such as input resistance, as well as time and space constants, parameters that are crucial for excitability and spatio temporal integration. Using detailed computer simulations of neocortical pyramidal cells, we show that the spontaneous background firing of the network provides a means for setting these parameters. The mechanism for this control is through the large conductance change of the membrane that is induced by both non-NMDA and NMDA excitatory and inhibitory synapses activated by the spontaneous background activity. 1 INTRODUCTION Biological neurons display a complexity rarely heeded in abstract network models.

Learning in Feedforward Networks with Nonsmooth,"This paper is concerned with the problem of learning in networks where some or all of the functions involved are not smooth. Examples of such networks are those whose neural transfer functions are piecewise-linear and those whose error function is defined in terms of the 100 norm. Up to now, networks whose neural transfer functions are piecewise-linear have received very little consideration in the literature, but the possibility of using an error function defined in terms of the 100 norm has received some attention. In this latter work, however, the problems that can occur when gradient methods are used for non smooth error functions have not been addressed. In this paper we draw upon some recent results from the field of nonsmooth optimization (NSO) to present an algorithm for the non smooth case. Our moti vation for this work arose out of the fact that we have been able to show that, in backpropagation, an error function based upon the 100 norm overcomes the difficulties which can o",Optimization & Theoretical ML,1be3bc32e6564055d5ca3e5a354acbef-Paper.pdf,1991
Constructing Proofs in Symmetric Networks,"This paper considers the problem of expressing predicate calculus in con nectionist networks that are based on energy minimization. Given a first order-logic knowledge base and a bound k, a symmetric network is con structed (like a Boltzman machine or a Hopfield network) that searches for a proof for a given query. If a resolution-based proof of length no longer than k exists, then the global minima of the energy function that is associated with the network represent such proofs. The network that is generated is of size cubic in the bound k and linear in the knowledge size. There are no restrictions on the type of logic formulas that can be represented. The network is inherently fault tolerant and can cope with inconsistency and nonmonotonicity. 1 Introduction The ability to reason from acquired knowledge is undoubtedly one of the basic and most important components of human intelligence.

A Weighted Probabilistic Neural Network,"The Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) algorithm represents the likeli hood function of a given class as the sum of identical, isotropic Gaussians. In practice, PNN is often an excellent pattern classifier, outperforming other classifiers including backpropagation. However, it. is not. robust with respect to affine transformations of feature space, and this can lead to poor performance on certain data. We have derived an extension of PNN called Weighted PNN (WPNN) which compensates for this flaw by allow ing anisotropic Gaussians, i.e. Gaussians whose covariance is not a mul tiple of the identity matrix. The covariance is optimized using a genetic algorithm, some interesting features of which are its redundant, logarith mic encoding and large population size. Experimental results validate our claims. 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 PROBABILISTIC NEURAL NETWORKS (PNN) PNN (Specht 1990) is a pattern classification algorithm which falls into the broad class of ""nearest-neighbor-like"" algorithms.

Shooting Craps in Search of an Optimal Strategy for,We compare two strategies for training connectionist (as well as non connectionist) models for statistical pattern recognition. The probabilistic strat egy is based on the notion that Bayesian discrimination (i.e .â¢ optimal classifica tion) is achieved when the classifier learns the a posteriori class distributions of the random feature vector. The differential strategy is based on the notion that the identity of the largest class a posteriori probability of the feature vector is all that is needed to achieve Bayesian discrimination. Each strategy is directly linked to a family of objective functions that can be used in the supervised training procedure. We prove that the probabilistic strategy - linked with error measure objective functions such as mean-squared-error and cross-entropy - typically used to train classifiers necessarily requires larger training sets and more complex classifier architectures than those needed to approximate the Bayesian discrim inant function.

Multimodular Architecture for Remote Sensing,"This paper deals with an application of Neural Networks to satellite remote sensing observations. Because of the complexity of the application and the large amount of data, the problem cannot be solved by using a single method. The solution we propose is to build multi modules NN architectures where several NN cooperate together. Such system suffer from generic problem for whom we propose solutions. They allow to reach accurate performances for multi-valued function approximations and probability estimations. The results are compared with six other methods which have been used for this problem. We show that the methodology we have developed is general and can be used for a large variety of applications. 675 676 Thiria, Mejia, Badran, and Crepon 1 INTRODUCTION Neural Networks have been used for many years to solve hard real world applications which involve large amounts of data.

Learning in the Vestibular System:,"Vestibular compensation is the process whereby normal functioning is regained following destruction of one member of the pair of peripheral vestibular receptors. Compensation was simulated by lesioning a dynamic neural network model of the vestibulo~ular reflex (VOR) and retraining it using recurrent back-propagation. The model reproduced the pattern of VOR neuron activity experimentally observed in compensated animals, but only if connections heretofore considered uninvolved were allowed to be plastic. Because the model incorporated nonlinear units, it was able to reconcile previously conflicting, linear analyses of experimental results on the dynamic properties of VOR neurons in normal and compensated animals. 1 VESTIBULAR COMPENSATION Vestibular compensation is one of the oldest and most well studied paradigms in motor learning.

Repeat Until Bored: A Pattern Selection Strategy,"An alternative to the typical technique of selecting training examples independently from a fixed distribution is fonnulated and analyzed, in which the current example is presented repeatedly until the error for that item is reduced to some criterion value, ~; then, another item is ran domly selected. The convergence time can be dramatically increased or decreased by this heuristic, depending on the task, and is very sensitive to the value of ~. 1 INTRODUCTION In order to implement the back propagation learning procedure (Werbos, 1974; Parker, 1985; Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams, 1986), several issues must be addressed. In addi tion to designing an appropriate network architecture and detennining appropriate values for the learning parameters, the batch size and a scheme for selecting training examples must be chosen.

Refining PIn Controllers using Neural Networks,"The KBANN approach uses neural networks to refine knowledge that can be written in the form of simple propositional rules. We extend this idea further by presenting the MANNCON algorithm by which the mathematical equations governing a PID controller determine the topology and initial weights of a network, which is further trained using backpropagation. We apply this method to the task of controlling the outflow and temperature of a water tank, producing statistically-significant gains in accuracy over both a standard neural network approach and a non-learning PID con troller. Furthermore, using the PID knowledge to initialize the weights of the network produces statistically less variation in testset accuracy when compared to networks initialized with small random numbers. 1 INTRODUCTION Research into the design of neural networks for process control has largely ignored existing knowledge about the task at hand.

A Cortico-Cerebellar Model that Learns to,"A neurophysiologically-based model is presented that controls a simulated kinematic arm during goal-directed reaches. The network generates a quasi-feedforward motor command that is learned using training signals generated by corrective movements. For each target, the network selects and sets the output of a subset of pattern generators. During the move ment, feedback from proprioceptors turns off the pattern generators. The task facing individual pattern generators is to recognize when the arm reaches the target and to turn off. A distributed representation of the mo tor command that resembles population vectors seen in vivo was produced naturally by these simulations. 1 INTRODUCTION We have recently begun to explore the properties of sensorimotor networks with architectures inspired by the anatomy and physiology of the cerebellum and its in terconnections with the red nucleus and the motor cortex (Houk 1989; Houk et al.. 611 612 Berthier, Singh, Barto, and Houk 1990).

Linear Operator for Object Recognition,"Visual object recognition involves the identification of images of 3-D ob jects seen from arbitrary viewpoints. We suggest an approach to object recognition in which a view is represented as a collection of points given by their location in the image. An object is modeled by a set of 2-D views together with the correspondence between the views. We show that any novel view of the object can be expressed as a linear combination of the stored views. Consequently, we build a linear operator that distinguishes between views of a specific object and views of other objects. This opera tor can be implemented using neural network architectures with relatively simple structures. 1 Introduction Visual object recognition involves the identification of images of 3-D objects seen from arbitrary viewpoints. In particular, objects often appear in images from previ ously unseen viewpoints.

Instead, use your sequence learning algorithm (any will do) to implement the following method for history compression. No matter what your fi nal goals are, train a network to predict its next input from the previous ones. Since only unpredictable inputs convey new information, ignore all predictable inputs but let all unexpected inputs (plus information about the time step at which they occurred) become inputs to a higher-level network of the same kind (working on a slower, self-adjusting time scale). Go on building a hierarchy of such networks. This principle reduces the descriptions of event sequences without 1088 of information, thus easing supervised or reinforcement learning tasks. Alternatively, you may use two recurrent networks to collapse a multi-level predictor hierarchy into a single recurrent net.

Some Approximation Properties of Projection,"This paper will address an important question in machine learning: What kind of network architectures work better on what kind of problems? A projection pursuit learning network has a very similar structure to a one hidden layer sigmoidal neural network. A general method based on a continuous version of projection pursuit regression is developed to show that projection pursuit regression works better on angular smooth func tions than on Laplacian smooth functions. There exists a ridge function approximation scheme to avoid the curse of dimensionality for approxi mating functions in L2(Â¢d). 1 INTRODUCTION Projection pursuit is a nonparametric statistical technique to find ""interesting"" low dimensional projections of high dimensional data sets. It has been used for nonparametric fitting and other data-analytic purposes (Friedman and Stuetzle, 1981, Huber, 1985).

Neural Computing with Small Weights,"An important issue in neural computation is the dynamic range of weights in the neural networks. Many experimental results on learning indicate that the weights in the networks can grow prohibitively large with the size of the inputs. Here we address this issue by studying the tradeoffs between the depth and the size of weights in polynomial-size networks of linear threshold elements (LTEs). We show that there is an efficient way of simulating a network of LTEs with large weights by a network of LTEs with small weights. In particular, we prove that every depth-d, polynomial-size network of LTEs with exponentially large integer weights + can be simulated by a depth-(2d 1), polynomial-size network of LTEs with polynomially bounded integer weights. To prove these results, we use tools from harmonic analysis of Boolean functions. Our technique is quite general, it provides insights to some other problems.

A Segment-based Automatic Language,"We have developed a four-language automatic language identification sys tem for high-quality speech. The system uses a neural network-based segmentation algorithm to segment speech into seven broad phonetic cat egories.

A Topographic Product for the Optimization,"Optimizing the performance of self-organizing feature maps like the Ko honen map involves the choice of the output space topology. We present a topographic product which measures the preservation of neighborhood relations as a criterion to optimize the output space topology of the map with regard to the global dimensionality DA as well as to the dimensi ons in the individual directions. We test the topographic product method not only on synthetic mapping examples, but also on speech data. In the latter application our method suggests an output space dimensionality of = DA 3, in coincidence with recent recognition results on the same data set. 1 INTRODUCTION Self-organizing feature maps like the Kohonen map (Kohonen, 1989, Ritter et al., 1990) not only provide a plausible explanation for the formation of maps in brains, e.g. in the visual system (Obermayer et al., 1990), but have also been applied to problems like vector quantization, or robot arm control (Martinetz et al., 1990).

We show that this problem is equivalent to the one of compressing information by data re moval and the one oflearning how to teach. Our key step is to introduce a process that statistically selects the data according to the model.

It involves formulating a vision problem as Bayesian inference or decision on a comprehensive model of the visual domain given by a probabilistic grammar. 1 INTRODUCTION I show how systematically to derive optimizing neural networks that represent quan titative visual models and match them to data. This involves a design methodology which starts from first principles, namely a probabilistic model of a visual domain, and proceeds via Bayesian inference to a neural network which performs a visual task. The key problem is to find probability distributions sufficiently intricate to model general visual tasks and yet tractable enough for theory.

Hierarchical Transformation of Space in the,"Neurons encoding simple visual features in area VI such as orientation, direction of motion and color are organized in retinotopic maps. How ever, recent physiological experiments have shown that the responses of many neurons in VI and other cortical areas are modulated by the di rection of gaze. We have developed a neural network model of the visual cortex to explore the hypothesis that visual features are encoded in head centered coordinates at early stages of visual processing. New experiments are suggested for testing this hypothesis using electrical stimulations and psychophysical observations. 1 Introduction Early visual processing in cortical areas VI, V2 and MT appear to encode visual features in eye-centered coordinates. This is based primarily on anatomical data and recordings from neurons in these areas, which are arranged in retinotopic maps.

It is also shown that, in agreement with psychophysical findings, the computation requires at least a sign-bit image as input - contours alone are not sufficient. 1 Introduction The task of visual recognition is natural and effortless for biological systems, yet the problem of recognition has been proven to be very difficult to analyze from a computational point of view. The fundamental reason is that novel images of familiar objects are often not sufficiently similar to previously seen images of that object. Assuming a rigid and isolated object in the scene, there are two major sources for this variability: geometric and photometric.

Networks,"The complexity of learning in shallow I-Dimensional neural networks has been shown elsewhere to be linear in the size of the network. However, when the network has a huge number of units (as cortex has) even linear time might be unacceptable. Furthermore, the algorithm that was given to achieve this time was based on a single serial processor and was biologically implausible. In this work we consider the more natural parallel model of processing and demonstrate an expected-time complexity that is constant (i.e. in dependent of the size of the network). This holds even when inter-node communication channels are short and local, thus adhering to more bio logical and VLSI constraints. 1 Introduction Shallow neural networks are defined in [J ud90]; the definition effectively limits the depth of networks while allowing the width to grow arbitrarily, and it is used as a model of neurological tissue like cortex where neurons are arranged in arrays tens of millions of neurons wide but only ten",Optimization & Theoretical ML,42998cf32d552343bc8e460416382dca-Paper.pdf,1991

Against Edges: Function Approximation with,"Networks for reconstructing a sparse or noisy function often use an edge field to segment the function into homogeneous regions, This approach assumes that these regions do not overlap or have disjoint parts, which is often false. For example, images which contain regions split by an occlud ing object can't be properly reconstructed using this type of network. We have developed a network that overcomes these limitations, using support maps to represent the segmentation of a signal. In our approach, the sup port of each region in the signal is explicitly represented. Results from an initial implementation demonstrate that this method can reconstruct images and motion sequences which contain complicated occlusion. 1 Introduction The task of efficiently approximating a function is central to the solution of many important problems in perception and cognition.

Generalization Performance in PARSEC-A,"This paper presents PARSEC-a system for generating connectionist parsing networks from example parses. PARSEC is not based on formal grammar systems and is geared toward spoken language tasks. PARSEC networks exhibit three strengths important for application to speech pro cessing: 1) they learn to parse, and generalize well compared to hand coded grammars; 2) they tolerate several types of noise; 3) they can learn to use multi-modal input. Presented are the PARSEC architecture and performance analyses along several dimensions that demonstrate PARSEC's features. PARSEC's performance is compared to that of tra ditional grammar-based parsing systems. 1 INTRODUCTION While a great deal of research has been done developing parsers for natural language, ade quate solutions for some of the particular problems involved in spoken language have not been found. Among the unsolved problems are the difficulty in constructing task-specific grammars, lack of tolerance to noisy input, and inability to ",NLP,598b3e71ec378bd83e0a727608b5db01-Paper.pdf,1991
Hierarchies of adaptive experts,"In this paper we present a neural network architecture that discovers a recursive decomposition of its input space. Based on a generalization of the modular architecture of Jacobs, Jordan, Nowlan, and Hinton (1991), the architecture uses competition among networks to recursively split the input space into nested regions and to learn separate associative mappings within each region. The learning algorithm is shown to perform gradient ascent in a log likelihood function that captures the architecture's hierarchical structure. 1 INTRODUCTION Neural network learning architectures such as the multilayer perceptron and adap tive radial basis function (RBF) networks are a natural nonlinear generalization of classical statistical techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression and additive modeling. Another class of nonlinear algorithms, exemplified by CART (Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, & Stone, 1984) and MARS (Friedman, 1990), gen eralizes classical techniques by partitioning the trai",Deep Learning,59b90e1005a220e2ebc542eb9d950b1e-Paper.pdf,1991
Optical Implementation of a SelfÂ·Organizing,"We demonstrate a self-organizing system based on photorefrac tive ring oscillators. We employ the system in two ways that can both be thought of as feature extractors; one acts on a set of images exposed repeatedly to the system strictly as a linear feature extractor, and the other serves as a signal demultiplex er for fiber optic communications. Both systems implement unsupervised competitive learning embedded within the mode interaction dynamics between the modes of a set of ring oscilla tors. After a training period, the modes of the rings become as sociated with the different image features or carrier frequencies within the incoming data stream. 1 Introduction Self-organizing networks (Kohonen, Hertz, Domany) discover features or qual ities about their input environment on their own; they learn without a teacher making explicit what is to be learned.

A Neurocomputer Board Based on the ANNA,"A board is described that contains the ANN A neural-network chip, and a DSP32C digital signal processor. The ANNA (Analog Neural Network Arithmetic unit) chip performs mixed analog/digital processing. The combination of ANNA with the DSP allows high-speed, end-to-end ex ecution of numerous signal-processing applications, including the prepro cessing, the neural-net calculations, and the postprocessing steps. The ANNA board evaluates neural networks 10 to 100 times faster than the DSP alone. The board is suitable for implementing large (million con nections) networks with sparse weight matrices. Three applications have been implemented on the board: a convolver network for slant detection of text blocks, a handwritten digit recognizer, and a neural network for recognition-based segmentation. 1 INTRODUCTION Many researchers have built neural-network chips, but few chips have been installed in board-level systems, even though this next level of integration provides insights and advantages",Computer Vision,5e388103a391daabe3de1d76a6739ccd-Paper.pdf,1991
Adaptive Synchronization of,"Animal locomotion patterns are controlled by recurrent neural networks called central pattern generators (CPGs). Although a CPG can oscillate autonomously, its rhythm and phase must be well coordinated with the state of the physical system using sensory inputs. In this paper we propose a learning algorithm for synchronizing neural and physical oscillators with specific phase relationships. Sensory input connections are modified by the correlation between cellular activities and input signals. Simulations show that the learning rule can be used for setting sensory feedback connections to a CPG as well as coupling connections between CPGs. 1 CENTRAL AND SENSORY MECHANISMS IN LOCOMOTION CONTROL Patterns of animal locomotion, such as walking, swimming, and fiying, are generated by recurrent neural networks that are located in segmental ganglia of invertebrates and spinal cords of vertebrates (Barnes and Gladden, 1985).

Recurrent Networks and N ARMA Modeling,"There exist large classes of time series, such as those with nonlinear moving average components, that are not well modeled by feedforward networks or linear models, but can be modeled by recurrent networks. We show that recurrent neural networks are a type of nonlinear autoregressive-moving average (N ARMA) model. Practical ability will be shown in the results of a competition sponsored by the Puget Sound Power and Light Company, where the recurrent networks gave the best performance on electric load forecasting. 1 Introduction This paper will concentrate on identifying types of time series for which a recurrent network provides a significantly better model, and corresponding prediction, than a feedforward network. Our main interest is in discrete time series that are par simoniously modeled by a simple recurrent network, but for which, a feedforward neural network is highly non-parsimonious by virtue of requiring an infinite amount of past observations as input to achieve the same ac",NLP,5ef0b4eba35ab2d6180b0bca7e46b6f9-Paper.pdf,1991
ANN Based Classification for Heart Defibrillators,Current Intra-Cardia defibrillators make use of simple classification algo rithms to determine patient conditions and subsequently to enable proper therapy. The simplicity is primarily due to the constraints on power dissipa tion and area available for implementation.

Adaptive Development of Connectionist Decoders,"\Ve present. an approach for df'velopment of a decoder for any complex binary error-correct.ing code- (ECC) via training from examples of decoded received words. Our decoder is a connectionist architecture.

Although both solutions meet our basic approach constraint for simplicity and compact ness. only the ECC-Enhanced Decoder meet.s our second basic constraint of being a generic solution. 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 THE DECODING PROBLEM An error-correcting code (ECC) is used to identify and correct errors in a received binary vector which is possibly corrupted clue to transmission across a noisy channel.

Self-organisation in real neurons:,"Ion channels are the dynamical systems of the nervous system. Their distribution within the membrane governs not only communication of in formation between neurons, but also how that information is integrated within the cell. Here, an argument is presented for an 'anti-Hebbian' rule for changing the distribution of voltage-dependent ion channels in order to flatten voltage curvatures in dendrites. Simulations show that this rule can account for the self-organisation of dynamical receptive field properties such as resonance and direction selectivity. It also creates the conditions for the faithful conduction within the cell of signals to which the cell has been exposed. Various possible cellular implementations of such a learn ing rule are proposed, including activity-dependent migration of channel proteins in the plane of the membrane. 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 NEURAL DYNAMICS Neural inputs and outputs are temporal, but there are no established ways to think about temporal learning and dynami",Reinforcement Learning,647bba344396e7c8170902bcf2e15551-Paper.pdf,1991
Tangent Prop - A formalism for specifying,"In many machine learning applications, one has access, not only to training data, but also to some high-level a priori knowledge about the desired be havior of the system. For example, it is known in advance that the output of a character recognizer should be invariant with respect to small spa tial distortions of the input images (translations, rotations, scale changes, etcetera). We have implemented a scheme that allows a network to learn the deriva tive of its outputs with respect to distortion operators of our choosing. This not only reduces the learning time and the amount of training data, but also provides a powerful language for specifying what generalizations we wish the network to perform. 1 INTRODUCTION In machine learning, one very often knows more about the function to be learned than just the training data. An interesting case is when certain directional deriva tives of the desired function are known at certain points.

Human and Machine 'Quick Modeling',"We present here an interesting experiment in 'quick modeling' by humans, performed independently on small samples, in several languages and two continents, over the last three years. Comparisons to decision tree proce dures and neural net processing are given. From these, we conjecture that human reasoning is better represented by the latter, but substantially dif ferent from both. Implications for the 'strong convergence hypothesis' be tween neural networks and machine learning are discussed, now expanded to include human reasoning comparisons. 1 INTRODUCTION Until recently the fields of symbolic and connectionist learning evolved separately. Suddenly in the last two years a significant number of papers comparing the two methodologies have appeared. A beginning synthesis of these two fields was forged at the NIPS '90 Workshop #5 last year (Pratt and Norton, 1990), where one may find a good bibliography of the recent work of Atlas, Dietterich, Omohundro, Sanger, Shavlik, Tsoi, Utgoff a",NLP,67f7fb873eaf29526a11a9b7ac33bfac-Paper.pdf,1991
A Network of Localized Linear Discriminants,"The localized linear discriminant network (LLDN) has been designed to address classification problems containing relatively closely spaced data from different classes (encounter zones [1], the accuracy problem [2]). Locally trained hyper plane segments are an effective way to define the decision boundaries for these regions [3]. The LLD uses a modified perceptron training algorithm for effective discovery of separating hyperplane/sigmoid units within narrow boundaries. The basic unit of the network is the discriminant receptive field (DRF) which combines the LLD function with Gaussians representing the dispersion of the local training data with respect to the hyperplane. The DRF implements a local distance mea sure [4], and obtains the benefits of networks oflocalized units [5]. A constructive algorithm for the two-class case is described which incorporates DRF's into the hidden layer to solve local discrimination problems.

Multi-Digit Recognition Using A Space,"We present a feed-forward network architecture for recognizing an uncon strained handwritten multi-digit string. This is an extension of previous work on recognizing isolated digits. In this architecture a single digit rec ognizer is replicated over the input. The output layer of the network is coupled to a Viterbi alignment module that chooses the best interpretation of the input. Training errors are propagated through the Viterbi module. The novelty in this procedure is that segmentation is done on the feature maps developed in the Space Displacement Neural Network (SDNN) rather than the input (pixel) space. 1 Introduction In previous work (Le Cun et al., 1990) we have demonstrated a feed-forward back propagation network that recognizes isolated handwritten digits at state-of-the-art performance levels.

Practical Issues in Temporal Difference Learning,"This paper examines whether temporal difference methods for training connectionist networks, such as Suttons's TO('\) algorithm, can be suc cessfully applied to complex real-world problems. A number of important practical issues are identified and discussed from a general theoretical per spective. These practical issues are then examined in the context of a case study in which TO('\) is applied to learning the game of backgammon from the outcome of self-play. This is apparently the first application of this algorithm to a complex nontrivial task. It is found that, with zero knowledge built in, the network is able to learn from scratch to play the entire game at a fairly strong intermediate level of performance, which is clearly better than conventional commercial programs, and which in fact surpasses comparable networks trained on a massive human expert data set.

Iterative Construction of,"We present an iterative algorithm for nonlinear regression based on con struction of sparse polynomials. Polynomials are built sequentially from lower to higher order. Selection of new terms is accomplished using a novel look-ahead approach that predicts whether a variable contributes to the remaining error. The algorithm is based on the tree-growing heuristic in LMS Trees which we have extended to approximation of arbitrary poly nomials of the input features. In addition, we provide a new theoretical justification for this heuristic approach. The algorithm is shown to dis cover a known polynomial from samples, and to make accurate estimates of pixel values in an image-processing task. 1 INTRODUCTION Linear regression attempts to approximate a target function by a model that is a linear combination of the input features. Its approximation ability is thus limited by the available features. We describe a method for adding new features that are products or powers of existing features.

A Computational Mechanism To Account For,"Using the double-step target displacement paradigm the mechanisms un derlying arm trajectory modification were investigated. Using short (10- 110 msec) inter-stimulus intervals the resulting hand motions were initially directed in between the first and second target locations. The kinematic features of the modified motions were accounted for by the superposition scheme, which involves the vectorial addition of two independent point-to point motion units: one for moving the hand toward an internally specified location and a second one for moving between that location and the final target location. The similarity between the inferred internally specified lo cations and previously reported measured end-points of the first saccades in double-step eye-movement studies may suggest similarities between per ceived target locations in eye and hand motor control. 1 INTRODUCTION The generation of reaching movements toward unexpectedly displaced targets in volves more complicated planning and cont",Optimization & Theoretical ML,7d04bbbe5494ae9d2f5a76aa1c00fa2f-Paper.pdf,1991
Learning Global Direct Inverse Kinematics,"We introduce and demonstrate a bootstrap method for construction of an in verse function for the robot kinematic mapping using only sample configuration space/workspace data. Unsupervised learning (clustering) techniques are used on pre-image neighborhoods in order to learn to partition the configuration space into subsets over which the kinematic mapping is invertible. Supervised leam ing is then used separately on each of the partitions to approximate the inverse function. The ill-posed inverse kinematics function is thereby regularized, and a globa1 inverse kinematics solution for the wristless Puma manipulator is devel oped. 1 INTRODUCTION The robot forward kinematics function is a continuous mapping f : C ~ en - w ~ Xm which maps a set of n joint parameters from the configuration space, C, to the m dimensiona1 task space, W.

This paper describes VISIT, a novel neural network model of visual attention. The current system models the search for target objects in scenes contain ing multiple distractors. This is a natural task for people, it is studied extensively by psychologists, and it requires attention. The network's be havior closely matches the known psychophysical data on visual search and visual attention.

Recognition of Manipulated Objects,"We present two neural network controller learning schemes based on feedback error-learning and modular architecture for recognition and control of multiple manipulated objects. In the first scheme, a Gating Network is trained to acquire object-specific representations for recognition of a number of objects (or sets of objects). In the second scheme, an Estimation Network is trained to acquire function-specific, rather than object-specific, representations which directly estimate physical parameters. Both recognition networks are trained to identify manipulated objects using somatic and/or visual information. After learning, appropriate motor commands for manipulation of each object are issued by the control networks. 1 INTRODUCTION Conventional feedforward neural-network controllers (Barto et aI., 1983; Psaltis et al., 1987; Kawato et aI., 1987, 1990; Jordan, 1988; Katayama & Kawato, 1991) can not cope with multiple or changeable manipulated objects or disturbances because they cannot ",Reinforcement Learning,81448138f5f163ccdba4acc69819f280-Paper.pdf,1991

Oscillatory Model of Short Term Memory,"We investigate a model in which excitatory neurons have dynamical thresh olds which display both fatigue and potentiation. The fatigue property leads to oscillatory behavior. It is responsible for the ability of the model to perform segmentation, i.e., decompose a mixed input into staggered oscillations of the activities of the cell-assemblies (memories) affected by it. Potentiation is responsible for sustaining these staggered oscillations after the input is turned off, i.e. the system serves as a model for short term memory. It has a limited STM capacity, reminiscent of the magical number 7 Â± 2. 1 Introduction The limited capacity (7 Â± 2) of the short term memory (STM) has been a subject of major interest in the psychological and physiological literature.

At each trial i, the learner is given a point Xi E X and asked to predict the value of I(xi). If the learner predicts I(xi) incorrectly, we say the learner makes a mistake.

Benchmarking Feed-Forward Neural Networks:,"Existing metrics for the learning performance of feed-forward neural networks do not provide a satisfactory basis for comparison because the choice of the training epoch limit can determine the results of the comparison. I propose new metrics which have the desirable property of being independent of the training epoch limit. The efficiency measures the yield of correct networks in proportion to the training effort expended. The optimal epoch limit provides the greatest efficiency. The learning performance is modelled statistically, and asymptotic performance is estimated.

Simulations demonstrate that a network can learn to represent three different functions simultaneously and canonical discriminant analysis is used to investigate bow operators and curried functions are represented in the space of bidden unit activations. 1 INTRODUCTION Many recent papers have contributed to the understanding of recurrent networks and their potential for modelling sequential pbenomena (see for example Giles, Sun, Chen, Lee, & Chen, 1990; Elman, 1989; 1990; Jordan, 1986; Cleeremans, Servan-Schreiber & McClelland, 1989; Williams & Zipser, 198",NLP,877a9ba7a98f75b90a9d49f53f15a858-Paper.pdf,1991
A Simple Weight Decay Can Improve,"It has been observed in numerical simulations that a weight decay can im prove generalization in a feed-forward neural network. This paper explains why. It is proven that a weight decay has two effects in a linear network. First, it suppresses any irrelevant components of the weight vector by choosing the smallest vector that solves the learning problem. Second, if the size is chosen right, a weight decay can suppress some of the effects of static noise on the targets, which improves generalization quite a lot. It is then shown how to extend these results to networks with hidden layers and non-linear units. Finally the theory is confirmed by some numerical simulations using the data from NetTalk. 1 INTRODUCTION Many recent studies have shown that the generalization ability of a neural network (or any other 'learning machine') depends on a balance between the information in the training examples and the complexity of the network, see for instance [1,2,3].

Obstacle Avoidance through Reinforcement,"A method is described for generating plan-like. reflexive. obstacle avoidance behaviour in a mobile robot. The experiments reported here use a simulated vehicle with a primitive range sensor. Avoidance behaviour is encoded as a set of continuous functions of the perceptual input space. These functions are stored using CMACs and trained by a variant of Barto and Sutton's adaptive critic algorithm. As the vehicle explores its surroundings it adapts its responses to sensory stimuli so as to minimise the negative reinforcement arising from collisions. Strategies for local navigation are therefore acquired in an explicitly goal-driven fashion.

The VC-Dimension versus the Statistical,"A general relationship is developed between the VC-dimension and the statistical lower epsilon-capacity which shows that the VC-dimension can be lower bounded (in order) by the statistical lower epsilon-capacity of a network trained with random samples. This relationship explains quan titatively how generalization takes place after memorization, and relates the concept of generalization (consistency) with the capacity of the optimal classifier over a class of classifiers with the same structure and the capacity of the Bayesian classifier. Furthermore, it provides a general methodology to evaluate a lower bound for the VC-dimension of feedforward multilayer neural networks. This general methodology is applied to two types of networks which are important for hardware implementations: two layer (N - 2L - 1) net works with binary weights, integer thresholds for the hidden units and zero threshold for the output unit, and a single neuron ((N - 1) net works) with binary weigths and a zero th",Optimization & Theoretical ML,9461cce28ebe3e76fb4b931c35a169b0-Paper.pdf,1991
Improving the Performance of Radial Basis,"Three methods for improving the performance of (gaussian) radial basis function (RBF) networks were tested on the NETtaik task. In RBF, a new example is classified by computing its Euclidean distance to a set of centers chosen by unsupervised methods. The application of supervised learning to learn a non-Euclidean distance metric was found to reduce the error rate of RBF networks, while supervised learning of each center's vari ance resulted in inferior performance. The best improvement in accuracy was achieved by networks called generalized radial basis function (GRBF) networks. In GRBF, the center locations are determined by supervised learning. After training on 1000 words, RBF classifies 56.5% of letters correct, while GRBF scores 73.4% letters correct (on a separate test set). From these and other experiments, we conclude that supervised learning of center locations can be very important for radial basis function learning. 1 Introduction Radial basis function (RBF) networks are 3-",Optimization & Theoretical ML,97e8527feaf77a97fc38f34216141515-Paper.pdf,1991
MODELS WANTED: MUST FIT DIMENSIONS,"During waking and sleep, the brain and mind undergo a tightly linked and precisely specified set of changes in state. At the level of neurons, this process has been modeled by variations of Volterra-Lotka equations for cyclic fluctuations of brainstem cell populations. However, neural network models based upon rapidly developing knowledge ofthe specific population connectivities and their differential responses to drugs have not yet been developed. Furthermore, only the most preliminary attempts have been made to model across states.

Merging Constrained Optimisation with,"Several parallel analogue algorithms, based upon mean field theory (MFT) approximations to an underlying statistical mechanics formulation, and re quiring an externally prescribed annealing schedule, now exist for finding approximate solutions to difficult combinatorial optimisation problems. They have been applied to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), as well as to various issues in computational vision and cluster analysis. I show here that any given MFT algorithm can be combined in a natural way with notions from the areas of constrained optimisation and adaptive simulated annealing to yield a single homogenous and efficient parallel re laxation technique, for which an externally prescribed annealing schedule is no longer required.

Neural Control for Rolling Mills: Incorporating,"In a Bayesian framework, we give a principled account of how domain specific prior knowledge such as imperfect analytic domain theories can be optimally incorporated into networks of locally-tuned units: by choosing a specific architecture and by applying a specific training regimen. Our method proved successful in overcoming the data deficiency problem in a large-scale application to devise a neural control for a hot line rolling mill. It achieves in this application significantly higher accuracy than optimally-tuned standard algorithms such as sigmoidal backpropagation, and outperforms the state-of-the-art solution. 1 INTRODUCTION Learning in connectionist networks typically requires many training examples and relies more or less explicitly on some kind of syntactic preference bias such as ""mini mal architecture"" (Rumelhart, 1988; Le Cun et ai., 1990; Weigend, 1991; inter alia) or a smoothness constraint operator (Poggio et ai., 1990), but does not make use of explicit representation",Optimization & Theoretical ML,9a96876e2f8f3dc4f3cf45f02c61c0c1-Paper.pdf,1991

Forward Dynamics Modeling,"We propose a paradigm for modeling speech production based on neural networks. We focus on characteristics of the musculoskeletal system. Using real physiological data - articulator movements and EMG from muscle activity a neural network learns the forward dynamics relating motor commands to muscles and the ensuing articulator behavior. After learning, simulated perturbations, were used to asses properties of the acquired model, such as natural frequency, damping, and interarticulator couplings. Finally, a cascade neural network is used to generate continuous motor commands from a sequence of discrete articulatory targets. 1 INTRODUCTION A key problem in the formal study of human language is to understand the process by which linguistic intentions become speech.

Learning to Segment Images,"Despite the fact that complex visual scenes contain multiple, overlapping objects, people perform object recognition with ease and accuracy. One operation that facilitates recognition is an early segmentation process in which features of objects are grouped and labeled according to which ob ject they belong. Current computational systems that perform this oper ation are based on predefined grouping heuristics. We describe a system called MAGIC that learn. how to group features based on a set of pre segmented examples. In many cases, MAGIC discovers grouping heuristics similar to those previously proposed, but it also has the capability of find ing nonintuitive structural regularities in images. Grouping is performed by a relaxation network that aUempts to dynamically bind related fea tures.

Simulation of Optimal Movements Using the,"This work discusses various optimization techniques which were proposed in models for controlling arm movements. In particular, the minimum-muscle-tension-change model is investigated. A dynamic simulator of the monkey's arm, including seventeen single and double joint muscles, is utilized to generate horizontal hand movements. The hand trajectories produced by this algorithm are discussed. 1 INTRODUCTION To perform a voluntary hand movement, the primate nervous system must solve the following problems: (A) Which trajectory (hand path and velocity) should be used while moving the hand from the initial to the desired position. (lB) What muscle forces should be generated. Those two problems are termed ""ill-posed"" because they can be solved in an infinite number of ways.

Neural Network Analysis of Event Related,"Automated monitoring of vigilance in attention intensive tasks such as air traffic control or sonar operation is highly desirable. As the opera tor monitors the instrument, the instrument would monitor the operator, insuring against lapses. We have taken a first step toward this goal by us ing feedforward neural networks trained with backpropagation to interpret event related potentials (ERPs) and electroencephalogram (EEG) associ ated with periods of high and low vigilance. The accuracy of our system on an ERP data set averaged over 28 minutes was 96%, better than the 83% accuracy obtained using linear discriminant analysis. Practical vigilance monitoring will require prediction over shorter time periods. We were able to average the ERP over as little as 2 minutes and still get 90% correct prediction of a vigilance measure. Additionally, we achieved similarly good performance using segments of EEG power spectrum as short as 56 sec. 1 INTRODUCTION Many tasks in society demand sustained",NLP,a760880003e7ddedfef56acb3b09697f-Paper.pdf,1991

We demonstrate this neu ral network architecture on character recognition using the NIST database and report on results herein. The resulting system simultaneously seg ments and recognizes touching or overlapping characters, broken charac ters, and noisy images with high accuracy. 1 INTRODUCTION Standard pattern recognition systems usually involve a segmentation step prior to the recognition step. For example, it is very common in character recognition to segment characters in a pre-processing step then normalize the individual characters and pass them to a recognition engine such as a neural network, as in the work of LeCun et al. 1988, Martin and Pittman (1988).

A Comparison of Projection Pursuit and Neural,"Two projection based feedforward network learning methods for model free regression problems are studied and compared in this paper: one is the popular back-propagation learning (BPL); the other is the projection pursuit learning (PPL). Unlike the totally parametric BPL method, the PPL non-parametrically estimates unknown nonlinear functions sequen tially (neuron-by-neuron and layer-by-Iayer) at each iteration while jointly estimating the interconnection weights. In terms of learning efficiency, both methods have comparable training speed when based on a Gauss Newton optimization algorithm while the PPL is more parsimonious. In terms of learning robustness toward noise outliers, the BPL is more sensi tive to the outliers. 1 INTRODUCTION The back-propagation learning (BPL) networks have been used extensively for es sentially two distinct problem types, namely model-free regression and classification, 1159 1160 Hwang, Li, Maechler, Martin, and Schimert which have no a priori assumption a",Optimization & Theoretical ML,a8849b052492b5106526b2331e526138-Paper.pdf,1991
"Unsupervised Classifiers, Mutual Information","We derive criteria for training adaptive classifier networks to perform unsu pervised data analysis. The first criterion turns a simple Gaussian classifier into a simple Gaussian mixture analyser. The second criterion, which is much more generally applicable, is based on mutual information. It simpli fies to an intuitively reasonable difference between two entropy functions, one encouraging 'decisiveness,' the other 'fairness' to the alternat.ive in terpretations of the input. This 'firm but fair' criterion can be applied to any network that produces probability-type outputs, but it does not necessarily lead to useful behavior. 1 Unsupervised Classification One of the main distinctions made in discussing neural network architectures, and pattern analysis algorithms generally, is between supervised and unsupervised data analysis. We should therefore be interested in any method of building bridges between techniques in these two categories.

This paper argues that the optimization of learning rate, the number of experimental control deci sions before adequate performance is obtained, and robustness is of prime importance-if necessary at the expense of computation per control cy cle and memory requirement. This is motivated by the observation that a robot which requires two thousand learning steps to achieve adequate performance, or a robot which occasionally gets stuck while learning, will always be undesirable, whereas moderate computational expense can be accommodated by increasingly powerful computer hardware.

Green's Function Method for Fast On-line Learning,"The two well known learning algorithms of recurrent neural networks are the back-propagation (Rumelhart & el al., Werbos) and the forward propa gation (Williams and Zipser). The main drawback of back-propagation is its off-line backward path in time for error cumulation. This violates the on-line requirement in many practical applications. Although the forward propaga tion algorithm can be used in an on-line manner, the annoying drawback is the heavy computation load required to update the high dimensional sensitiv ity matrix (0( fir) operations for each time step). Therefore, to develop a fast forward algorithm is a challenging task. In this paper w~ proposed a forward learning algorithm which is one order faster (only 0(fV3) operations for each time step) than the sensitivity matrix algorithm.

By incorpo rating rules in this way, RuleNet exhibits enhanced learning and gener alization performance over alternative neural net approaches. By integrating symbolic rule learning and subsymbolic category learning, RuleNet has capabilities that go beyond a purely symbolic system. We show how this architecture can be applied to the problem of case-role assignment in natural language processing, yielding a novel rule-based solution. 1 INTRODUCTION We believe that neural networks are capable of more than pattern recognition; they can also perform higher cognitive tasks which are fund",NLP,cf67355a3333e6e143439161adc2d82e-Paper.pdf,1991
A comparison between a neural network model for,"Recently, high resolution images of the simultaneous representation of orientation preference, orientation selectivity and ocular dominance have been obtained for large areas in monkey striate cortex by optical imaging [1-3]. These data allow for the first time a ""local"" as well as ""global"" description of the spatial patterns and provide strong evidence for corre lations between orientation selectivity and ocular dominance. A quantitative analysis reveals that these correlations arise when a five dimensional feature space (two dimensions for retinotopic space, one each for orientation preference, orientation specificity, and ocular dominance) is mapped into the two available dimensions of cortex while locally preserving topology. These results provide strong evidence for the concept of topology preserving maps which have been suggested as a basic design principle of striate cortex [4-7].

A Connectionist Learning Approach to Analyzing,"We use connectionist modeling to develop an analysis of stress systems in terms of ease of learnability. In traditional linguistic analyses, learnability arguments determine default parameter settings based on the feasibilty of logicall y deducing correct settings from an initial state. Our approach provides an empirical alter native to such arguments. Based on perceptron learning experiments using data from nineteen human languages, we develop a novel characterization of stress patterns in terms of six parameters. These provide both a partial description of the stress pattern itself and a prediction of its learnability, without invoking abstract theoretical constructs such as metrical feet. This work demonstrates that ma chine learning methods can provide a fresh approach to understanding linguistic phenomena. 1 LINGUISTIC STRESS The domain of stress systems in language is considered to have a relatively good linguistic theory, called metrical phonologyl.

Stationarity of Synaptic Coupling Strength Between,"Based on a general non-stationary point process model, we computed estimates of the synaptic coupling strength (efficacy) as a function of time after stimulus onset between an inhibitory interneuron and its target postsynaptic cell in the feline dorsal cochlear nucleus. The data consist of spike trains from pairs of neurons responding to brief tone bursts recorded in vivo. Our results suggest that the synaptic efficacy is non-stationary. Further. synaptic efficacy is shown to be inversely and approximately linearly related to average presynaptic spike rate. A second-order analysis suggests that the latter result is not due to non-linear interactions. Synaptic efficacy is less strongly correlated with postsynaptic rate and the correlation is not consistent across neural pairs. 1 INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamic properties of the inhibitory effect of type IT neurons on type IV neurons in the cat dorsal cochlear nucleus (DeN).

Time-Warping Network:,"Recently. much interest has been generated regarding speech recognition systems based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and neural network (NN) hybrids. Such systems attempt to combine the best features of both models: the temporal structure of HMMs and the discriminative power of neural networks. In this work we define a time-warping (1W) neuron that extends the operation of the fonnal neuron of a back-propagation network by warping the input pattern to match it optimally to its weights. We show that a single-layer network of TW neurons is equivalent to a Gaussian density HMM based recognition system. and we propose to improve the discriminative power of this system by using back-propagation discriminative training. and/or by generalizing the structure of the recognizer to a multi-layered net The performance of the proposed network was evaluated on a highly confusable, isolated word. multi speaker recognition task.

Dual Inhibitory Mechanisms for Definition of,"In single cells of the cat striate cortex, lateral inhibition across orienta tion and/or spatial frequency is found to enhance pre-existing biases. A contrast-dependent but spatially non-selective inhibitory component is also found. Stimulation with ascending and descending contrasts reveals the latter as a response hysteresis that is sensitive, powerful and rapid, sug gesting that it is active in day-to-day vision. Both forms of inhibition are not recurrent but are rather network properties. These findings suggest two fundamental inhibitory mechanisms: a global mechanism that limits dynamic range and creates spatial selectivity through thresholding and a local mechanism that specifically refines spatial filter properties. Analysis of burst patterns in spike trains demonstrates that these two mechanisms have unique physiological origins. 1 INFORMATION PROCESSING IN STRIATE CORTICAL CELLS The most popular current model of single cells in the striate cortex casts them in terms of spatial",Computer Vision,db85e2590b6109813dafa101ceb2faeb-Paper.pdf,1991

Adaptive Elastic Models for Hand-Printed,"Hand-printed digits can be modeled as splines that are governed by about 8 control points. For each known digit. the control points have preferred ., home"" locations, and deformations of the digit are generated by moving the control points away from their home locations. Images of digits can be produced by placing Gaussian ink generators uniformly along the spline. Real images can be recognized by finding the digit model most likely to have generated the data. For each digit model we use an elastic matching algorithm to minimize an energy function that includes both the defor mation energy of the digit model and the log probability that the model would generate the inked pixels in the image. The model with the lowest total energy wins. If a uniform noise process is included in the model of image generation, some of the inked pixels can be rejected as noise as a digit model is fitting a poorly segmented image.

Modeling Applications with the Focused Gamma Net,"The focused gamma network is proposed as one of the possible implementations of the gamma neural model. The focused gamma network is compared with the focused backpropagation network and TDNN for a time series prediction problem, and with ADALINE in a system identification problem. 1 INTRODUCTION At NIPS-90 we introduced the gamma neural model, a real time neural net for temporal processing (de Vries and Principe, 1991). This model is characterized by a neural short term memory mechanism, the gamma memory structure, which is implemented as a tapped delay line of adaptive dispersive elements. The gamma model seems to provide an integrative framework to study the neural processing of time varying patterns (de Vries and Principe, 1992). In fact both the memory by delays as implemented in TDNN (Lang et aI, 1990) and memory by local feedback (self-recurrent loops) as proposed by Jordan (1986), and Elman (1990) are special cases of the gamma memory structure.

Statistical Reliability of a Blowfly,"We develop a model-independent method for characterizing the reliability of neural responses to brief stimuli. This approach allows us to measure the discriminability of similar stimuli, based on the real-time response of a single neuron. Neurophysiological data were obtained from a movement sensitive neuron (HI) in the visual system of the blowfly Calliphom ery throcephala. Furthermore, recordings were made from blowfly photore ceptor cells to quantify the signal to noise ratios in the peripheral visual system. As photoreceptors form the input to the visual system, the reli ability of their signals ultimately determines the reliability of any visual discrimination task. For the case of movement detection, this limit can be computed, and compared to the HI neuron's reliability. Under favor able conditions, the performance of the HI neuron closely approaches the theoretical limit, which means that under these conditions the nervous system adds little noise in the process of computing mo",NLP,dc6a6489640ca02b0d42dabeb8e46bb7-Paper.pdf,1991

Gradient Descent: Second-Order Momentum,"= Batch gradient descent, ~w(t) -7JdE/dw(t), conver~es to a minimum of quadratic form with a time constant no better than '4Amax/ Amin where Amin and Amax are the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of E with respect to w. It was recently shown that adding a momentum term ~w(t) = -7JdE/dw(t) + Q'~w(t - 1) improves this to ~ VAmax/ Amin, although only in the batch case.

Active Exploration in Dynamic Environments,"\Vhenever an agent learns to control an unknown environment, two oppos ing principles have to be combined, namely: exploration (long-term opti mization) and exploitation (short-term optimization). Many real-valued connectionist approaches to learning control realize exploration by ran domness in action selection. This might be disadvantageous when costs are assigned to ""negative experiences"". The basic idea presented in this paper is to make an agent explore unknown regions in a more directed manner. This is achieved by a so-called competence map, which is trained to predict the controller's accuracy, and is used for guiding exploration. Based on this, a bistable system enables smoothly switching attention between two behaviors - exploration and exploitation - depending on ex pected costs and knowledge gain. The appropriateness of this method is demonstrated by a simple robot navigation task.

Data Analysis using G/SPLINES,"G/SPLINES is an algorithm for building functional models of data. It uses genetic search to discover combinations of basis functions which are then used to build a least-squares regression model. Because it produces a population of models which evolve over time rather than a single model, it allows analysis not possible with other regression-based approaches. 1 INTRODUCTION G/SPLINES is a hybrid of Friedman's Multivariable Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) algorithm (Friedman, 1990) with Holland's Genetic Algorithm (Holland, 1975). G/SPLINES has advantages over MARS in that it requires fewer least-squares computations, is easily extendable to non-spline basis functions, may discover models inaccessible to local-variable selection algorithms, and allows significantly larger problems to be considered. These issues are discussed in (Rogers, 1991).

By computing contrast at edges, the retina reduces incident light intensities spanning twelve decades to a twentyfold variation. In one stroke, it solves the dynamic range problem and extracts relative reflec tivity, bringing us a step closer to the goal. We have built a contrast sensitive silicon retina that models all major synaptic interactions in the outer-plexiform layer of the vertebrate retina using current-mode CMOS circuits: namely, reciprocal synapses between cones and horizontal cells, which produce the antagonistic center/surround receptive field, and cone and horizontal cell gap junctions, which determine its size.

Information Measure Based Skeletonisation,"Automatic determination of proper neural network topology by trimming over-sized networks is an important area of study, which has previously been addressed using a variety of techniques. In this paper, we present Information Measure Based Skeletonisation (IMBS), a new approach to this problem where superfluous hidden units are removed based on their information measure (1M). This measure, borrowed from decision tree in duction techniques, reflects the degree to which the hyperplane formed by a hidden unit discriminates between training data classes. We show the results of applying IMBS to three classification tasks and demonstrate that it removes a substantial number of hidden units without significantly affecting network performance. 1 INTRODUCTION Neural networks can be evaluated based on their learning speed, the space and time complexity of the learned network, and generalisation performance.

Interpretation of Artificial Neural Networks:,"We propose and empirically evaluate a method for the extraction of expert comprehensible rules from trained neural networks. Our method operates in the context of a three-step process for learning that uses rule-based domain knowledge in combination with neural networks. Empirical tests using real worlds problems from molecular biology show that the rules our method extracts from trained neural networks: closely reproduce the accuracy of the network from which they came, are superior to the rules derived by a learning system that directly refines symbolic rules, and are expert-comprehensible. 1 Introduction Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have proven to be a powerful and general technique for machine learning [1, 11].

Competitive Anti-Hebbian Learning of Invariants,"Although the detection of invariant structure in a given set of input patterns is vital to many recognition tasks, connectionist learning rules tend to focus on directions of high variance (principal components). The prediction paradigm is often used to reconcile this dichotomy; here we suggest a more direct approach to invariant learning based on an anti-Hebbian learning rule. An unsupervised tWO-layer network implementing this method in a competitive setting learns to extract coherent depth information from random-dot stereograms. 1 INTRODUCTION: LEARNING INVARIANT STRUCTURE Many connectionist learning algorithms share with principal component analysis (Jolliffe, 1986) the strategy of extracting the directions of highest variance from the input.

Information Processing to Create Eye Movements,"Because eye muscles never cocontract and do not deal with external loads, one can write an equation that relates motoneuron firing rate to eye position and velocity - a very uncommon situation in the CNS. The semicircular canals transduce head velocity in a linear manner by using a high background discharge rate, imparting linearity to the premotor circuits that generate eye movements. This has allowed deducing some of the signal processing involved, including a neural network that integrates. These ideas are often summarized by block diagrams. Unfortunately, they are of little value in describing the behavior of single neurons - a fmding supported by neural network models. 1 INTRODUCTION The neural networks in our studies are quite simple.

Left-right HMMs with insertion and deletion states are then trained to represent several protein families including immunoglobulins and kinases. In all cases, the models derived capture all the important statistical properties of the families and can be used efficiently in a number of important tasks such as multiple alignment, motif de tection, and classification. *and Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology. t and Department of Psychology, Stanford University. 747 748 Baldi, Chauvin, Hunkapiller, and McClure 1 INTRODUCTION Hidden Markov Models (e.g., Rabiner, 1989) and the more general EM algorithm in statistics can be applied to the modeling and anal",NLP,051e4e127b92f5d98d3c79b195f2b291-Paper.pdf,1992
Statistical and Dynamical Interpretation of ISIH,"We interpret the time interval data obtained from periodically stimulated sensory neurons in terms of two simple dynamical systems driven by noise with an embedded weak periodic function called the signal: 1) a bistable system defined by two potential wells separated by a barrier, and 2) a Fit zHugh-Nagumo system. The implementation is by analog simulation: elec tronic circuits which mimic the dynamics. For a given signal frequency, our simulators have only two adjustable parameters, the signal and noise intensi ties. We show that experimental data obtained from the periodically stimu lated mechanoreceptor in the crayfish tail fan can be accurately approximated stochastic resonance by these simulations. Finally, we discuss in the two models. 1 INTRODUcnON It is well known that sensory information is transmitted to the brain using a code which must be based on the time intervals between neural firing events or the mean firing rate.

Spiral Waves in Integrate-and-Fire,"The formation of propagating spiral waves is studied in a randomly connected neural network composed of integrate-and-fire neurons with recovery period and excitatory connections using computer simulations. Network activity is initiated by periodic stimulation at a single point. The results suggest that spiral waves can arise in such a network via a sub-critical Hopf bifurcation. 1 Introduction In neural networks activity propagates through populations, or layers, of neurons. This propagation can be monitored as an evolution of spatial patterns of activity. Thirty years ago, computer simulations on the spread of activity through 2-D ran domly connected networks demonstrated that a variety of complex spatio-temporal patterns can be generated including target waves and spirals (Beurle, 1956, 1962; Farley and Clark, 1961; Farley, 1965).

Adaptive Stimulus Representations:,"We present a theory of cortico-hippocampal interaction in discrimination learning. The hippocampal region is presumed to form new stimulus representations which facilitate learning by enhancing the discriminability of predictive stimuli and compressing stimulus-stimulus redundancies. The cortical and cerebellar regions, which are the sites of long-term memory. may acquire these new representations but are not assumed to be capable of forming new representations themselves. Instantiated as a connectionist model. this theory accounts for a wide range of trial-level classical conditioning phenomena in normal (intact) and hippocampal-Iesioned animals. It also makes several novel predictions which remain to be investigated empirically. The theory implies that the hippocampal region is involved in even the simplest learning tasks; although hippocampal-Iesioned animals may be able to use other strategies to learn these tasks. the theory predicts that they will show consistently different patt",NLP,07c5807d0d927dcd0980f86024e5208b-Paper.pdf,1992
Computing with Almost Optimal Size Neural,"Artificial neural networks are comprised of an interconnected collection of certain nonlinear devices; examples of commonly used devices include linear threshold elements, sigmoidal elements and radial-basis elements. We employ results from harmonic analysis and the theory of rational ap proximation to obtain almost tight lower bounds on the size (i.e. number of elements) of neural networks. The class of neural networks to which our techniques can be applied is quite general; it includes any feedforward network in which each element can be piecewise approximated by a low degree rational function. For example, we prove that any depth-( d + 1) network of sigmoidal units or linear threshold elements computing the par ity function of n variables must have O(dnl/d-Â£) size, for any fixed > O. i In addition, we prove that this lower bound is almost tight by showing that the parity function can be computed with O(dnl/d) sigmoidal units + or linear threshold elements in a depth-(d 1) network.

Q-Learning with Hidden-Unit Restarting,"Platt's resource-allocation network (RAN) (Platt, 1991a, 1991b) is modified for a reinforcement-learning paradigm and to ""restart"" existing hidden units rather than adding new units. After restart ing, units continue to learn via back-propagation. The resulting restart algorithm is tested in a Q-Iearning network that learns to solve an inverted pendulum problem. Solutions are found faster on average with the restart algorithm than without it. 1 Introduction The goal of supervised learning is the discovery of a compact representation that generalizes well. Such representations are typically found by incremental, gradient based search, such as error back-propagation. However, in the early stages of learn ing a control task, we are more concerned with fast learning than a compact rep resentation. This implies a local representation with the extreme being the mem orization of each experience.

Synaptic Weight Noise During MLP,"We analyse the effects of analog noise on the synaptic arithmetic during MultiLayer Perceptron training, by expanding the cost func tion to include noise-mediated penalty terms. Predictions are made in the light of these calculations which suggest that fault tolerance, generalisation ability and learning trajectory should be improved by such noise-injection. Extensive simulation experiments on two distinct classification problems substantiate the claims. The re sults appear to be perfectly general for all training schemes where weights are adjusted incrementally, and have wide-ranging implica tions for all applications, particularly those involving ""inaccurate"" analog neural VLSI. 1 Introduction This paper demonstrates both by consjderatioll of the cost function and the learn ing equations, and by simulation experiments, that injection of random noise on to MLP weights during learning enhances fault-tolerance without additional super vision.

Rational Parametrizations of Neural,"A connection is drawn between rational functions, the realization theory of dynamical systems, and feedforward neural networks. This allows us to parametrize single hidden layer scalar neural networks with (almost) arbitrary analytic activation functions in terms of strictly proper rational functions. Hence, we can solve the uniqueness of parametrization problem for such networks. 1 INTRODUCTION Nonlinearly parametrized representations of functions Â¢: IR -+- IR of the form Ln = (1.1) Â¢(x) CiU(X - ai) x E IR, i=l have attracted considerable attention recently in the neural network literature.

Directional-Unit Boltzmann Machines,"We present a general formulation for a network of stochastic di rectional units. This formulation is an extension of the Boltzmann machine in which the units are not binary, but take on values in a cyclic range, between 0 and 271' radians. The state of each unit in a Directional-Unit Boltzmann Machine (DUBM) is described by a complex variable, where the phase component specifies a direction; the weights are also complex variables. We associate a quadratic energy function, and corresponding probability, with each DUBM configuration. The conditional distribution of a unit's stochastic state is a circular version of the Gaussian probability distribution, known as the von Mises distribution. In a mean-field approxima tion to a stochastic DUBM, the phase component of a unit's state represents its mean direction, and the magnitude component spec ifies the degree of certainty associated with this direction.

Drifting sinusoidal gratings were presented in the cells' overlapping receptive fields, and the stimulus was varied along several visual dimensions. The degree of dimensional separability was calculated for a large population of neurons, and found to be a continuum. Several cells showed different temporal response dependencies to variation of different stimulus dimensions, i.e. the tuning of the modulated firing was not necessarily the same as that of the mean firing rate. We describe a multidimensional receptive field, and use simultaneously recorded responses to compute a multi-neuron receptive field, describing the information processing capabilities of a group of cells. Using dynamic correlation analysis, we propose several computational schemes for multidimensional spatiotemporal tuning for groups of cells.

Assessing and Improving Neural Network,The bootstrap algorithm is a computational intensive procedure to derive nonparametric confidence intervals of statistical estimators in situations where an analytic solution is intractable. It is ap plied to neural networks to estimate the predictive distribution for unseen inputs. The consistency of different bootstrap procedures and their convergence speed is discussed. A small scale simulation experiment shows the applicability of the bootstrap to practical problems and its potential use. 1 INTRODUCTION Bootstrapping is a strategy for estimating standard errors and confidence intervals for parameters when the form of the underlying distribution is unknown. It is particularly valuable when the parameter of interest is a complicated functional of the true distribution.

Intersecting regions: The key to combinatorial,"Hidden units in multi-layer networks form a representation space in which each region can be identified with a class of equivalent outputs (Elman, 1989) or a logical state in a finite state machine (Cleeremans, Servan-Schreiber & McClelland, 1989; Giles, Sun, Chen, Lee, & Chen, 1990). We extend the analysis of the spatial structure of hidden unit space to a combinatorial task, based on binding features together in a visual scene. The logical structure requires a combinatorial number of states to represent all valid scenes. On analysing our networks, we find that the high dimensionality of hidden unit space is exploited by using the intersection of neighboring regions to represent conjunctions of features. These results show how combinatorial structure can be based on the spatial nature of networks, and not just on their emulation of logical structure. 1 TECHNIQUES FOR ANALYSING THE SPATIAL AND LOGICAL STRUCTURE OF HIDDEN UNIT SPACE In multi-layer networks, regions of hidden unit space ",NLP,10a5ab2db37feedfdeaab192ead4ac0e-Paper.pdf,1992
A Parallel Gradient Descent Method for Learning,"Typical methods for gradient descent in neural network learning involve calculation of derivatives based on a detailed knowledge of the network model. This requires extensive, time consuming calculations for each pat tern presentation and high precision that makes it difficult to implement in VLSI. We present here a perturbation technique that measures, not calculates, the gradient. Since the technique uses the actual network as a measuring device, errors in modeling neuron activation and synaptic weights do not cause errors in gradient descent. The method is parallel in nature and easy to implement in VLSI. We describe the theory of such an algorithm, an analysis of its domain of applicability, some simulations using it and an outline of a hardware implementation. 1 Introduction The most popular method for neural network learning is back-propagation (Rumel hart, 1986) and related algorithms that calculate gradients based on detailed knowl edge of the neural network model.

A Model of Feedback to the Lateral,"Simplified models of the lateral geniculate nucles (LGN) and stri ate cortex illustrate the possibility that feedback to the LG N may be used for robust, low-level pattern analysis. The information fed back to the LG N is rebroadcast to cortex using the LG N 's full fan-out, so the cortex-LGN-cortex pathway mediates extensive cortico-cortical communication while keeping the number of neces sary connections small. 1 INTRODUCTION The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the thalamus is often considered as just a relay station on the way from the retina to visual cortex, since receptive field prop erties of neurons in the LGN are very similar to retinal ganglion cell receptive field properties. However, there is a massive projection from cortex back to the LGN: it is estimated that 3-4 times more synapses in the LG N are due to corticogenicu late connections than those due to retinogeniculate connections [12]. This suggests some important processing role for the LGN, but the nature of the ",NLP,17c276c8e723eb46aef576537e9d56d0-Paper.pdf,1992
History-dependent Attractor Neural,"We present a methodological framework enabling a detailed de scription of the performance of Hopfield-like attractor neural net works (ANN) in the first two iterations. Using the Bayesian ap proach, we find that performance is improved when a history-based term is included in the neuron's dynamics. A further enhancement of the network's performance is achieved by judiciously choosing the censored neurons (those which become active in a given itera tion) on the basis of the magnitude of their post-synaptic poten tials. The contribution of biologically plausible, censored, history dependent dynamics is especially marked in conditions of low firing activity and sparse connectivity, two important characteristics of the mammalian cortex. In such networks, the performance at tained is higher than the performance of two 'independent' iter ations, which represents an upper bound on the performance of history-independent networks. 1 Introduction Associative Attractor Neural Network (ANN) models",NLP,185c29dc24325934ee377cfda20e414c-Paper.pdf,1992
Single-iteration Threshold Hamming,"We analyze in detail the performance of a Hamming network clas sifying inputs that are distorted versions of one of its m stored memory patterns. The activation function of the memory neurons in the original Hamming network is replaced by a simple threshold function. The resulting Threshold Hamming Network (THN) cor rectly classifies the input pattern, with probability approaching 1, using only O(mln m) connections, in a single iteration. The THN drastically reduces the time and space complexity of Hamming Net work classifiers. 1 Introduction Originally presented in (Steinbuch 1961, Taylor 1964) the Hamming network (HN) has received renewed attention in recent years (Lippmann et. al. 1987, Baum et. al. 1988).

Reinforcement Learning Applied to,"Recent research on reinforcement learning has focused on algo rithms based on the principles of Dynamic Programming (DP). One of the most promising areas of application for these algo rithms is the control of dynamical systems, and some impressive results have been achieved. However, there are significant gaps between practice and theory. In particular, there are no con ver gence proofs for problems with continuous state and action spaces, or for systems involving non-linear function approximators (such as multilayer perceptrons).

The Computation of Stereo Disparity for,"The classical computational model for stereo vision incorporates a uniqueness inhibition constraint to enforce a one-to-one feature match, thereby sacrificing the ability to handle transparency. Crit ics of the model disregard the uniqueness constraint and argue that the smoothness constraint can provide the excitation support required for transparency computation. However, this modifica tion fails in neighborhoods with sparse features. We propose a Bayesian approach to stereo vision with priors favoring cohesive over transparent surfaces. The disparity and its segmentation into a multi-layer ""depth planes"" representation are simultaneously com puted. The smoothness constraint propagates support within each layer, providing mutual excitation for non-neighboring transparent or partially occluded regions.

Learning Control Under Extreme,"A peg-in-hole insertion task is used as an example to illustrate the utility of direct associative reinforcement learning methods for learning control under real-world conditions of uncertainty and noise. Task complexity due to the use of an unchamfered hole and a clearance of less than 0.2mm is compounded by the presence of positional uncertainty of magnitude exceeding 10 to 50 times the clearance. Despite this extreme degree of uncertainty, our results indicate that direct reinforcement learning can be used to learn a robust reactive control strategy that results in skillful peg-in-hole insertions. 1 INTRODUCTION Many control tasks of interest today involve controlling complex nonlinear systems under uncertainty and noise.1 Because traditional control design techniques are not very effective under such circumstances, methods for learning control are becoming increasingly popular.

Global Regularization of Inverse Kinematics for Redundant,"The inverse kinematics problem for redundant manipulators is ill-posed and nonlinear. There are two fundamentally different issues which result in the need for some form of regularization; the existence of multiple solution branches (global ill-posedness) and the existence of excess degrees of freedom (local ill posedness). For certain classes of manipulators, learning methods applied to input-output data generated from the forward function can be used to globally regularize the problem by partitioning the domain of the forward mapping into a finite set of regions over which the inverse problem is well-posed. Local regularization can be accomplished by an appropriate parameterization of the redundancy consistently over each region. As a result, the ill-posed problem can be transformed into a finite set of well-posed problems.

"Information, prediction, and query by","We analyze the ""query by committee"" algorithm, a method for fil tering informative queries from a random stream of inputs. We show that if the two-member committee algorithm achieves infor mation gain with positive lower bound, then the prediction error decreases exponentially with the number of queries. We show that, in particular, this exponential decrease holds for query learning of thresholded smooth functions. 1 Introduction For the most part, research on supervised learning has utilized a random input paradigm, in which the learner is both trained and tested on examples drawn at random from the same distribution. In contrast, in the query paradigm, the learner is given the power to ask questions, rather than just passively accept examples. What does the learner gain from this additional power? Can it attain the same prediction performance with fewer examples? Most work on query learning has been in the constructive paradigm, in which the 483 484 Freund, Seung, Shamir, and Tishby ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,3871bd64012152bfb53fdf04b401193f-Paper.pdf,1992
Improving Convergence in Hierarchical,"We are interested in the use of analog neural networks for recog nizing visual objects. Objects are described by the set of parts they are composed of and their structural relationship. Struc tural models are stored in a database and the recognition prob lem reduces to matching data to models in a structurally consis tent way. The object recognition problem is in general very diffi cult in that it involves coupled problems of grouping, segmentation and matching. We limit the problem here to the simultaneous la belling of the parts of a single object and the determination of analog parameters. This coupled problem reduces to a weighted match problem in which an optimizing neural network must min imize E(M, p) = LO'i MO'i WO'i(p), where the {MO'd are binary match variables for data parts i to model parts a and {Wai(P)} are weights dependent on parameters p.

A dynamical model of priming and,"We describe a model of visual word recognition that accounts for several aspects of the temporal processing of sequences of briefly presented words. The model utilizes a new representation for writ ten words, based on dynamic time warping and multidimensional scaling. The visual input passes through cascaded perceptual, com parison, and detection stages. We describe how these dynamical processes can account for several aspects of word recognition, in cluding repetition priming and repetition blindness. 1 INTRODUCTION Several psychological phenomena show that the construction of organized and mean ingful representations of the visual environment requires establishing separate repre sentations (termed episodic representations) for the different objects viewed. Three phenomena in the word recognition literature suggest that the segregation of the visual flow into separate episodic representations can be characterized in terms of specific temporal constraints.

Unsupervised Discrimination of Clustered Data,"We present the information-theoretic derivation of a learning algorithm that clusters unlabelled data with linear discriminants. In contrast to methods that try to preserve information about the input patterns, we maximize the information gained from observing the output of robust binary discriminators implemented with sigmoid nodes. We deri ve a local weight adaptation rule via gradient ascent in this objective, demonstrate its dynamics on some simple data sets, relate our approach to previous work and suggest directions in which it may be extended. 1 INTRODUCTION Unsupervised learning algorithms may perform useful preprocessing functions by pre serving some aspects of their input while discarding others. This can be quantified as maximization of the information the network's output carries about those aspects of the input that are deemed important. (Linsker, 1988) suggests maximal preservation of information about all aspects of the input.

Using Aperiodic Reinforcement for Directed,"We present a local learning rule in which Hebbian learning is conditional on an incorrect prediction of a reinforcement signal. We propose a biological interpretation of such a framework and display its utility through examples in which the reinforcement signal is cast as the delivery of a neuromodulator to its target. Three exam pIes are presented which illustrate how this framework can be applied to the development of the oculomotor system. 1 INTRODUCTION Activity-dependent accounts of the self-organization of the vertebrate brain have relied ubiquitously on correlational (mainly Hebbian) rules to drive synaptic learn ing. In the brain, a major problem for any such unsupervised rule is that many different kinds of correlations exist at approximately the same time scales and each is effectively noise to the next. For example, relationships within and between the retinae among variables such as color, motion, and topography may mask one another and disrupt their appropriate segregation",Reinforcement Learning,44c4c17332cace2124a1a836d9fc4b6f-Paper.pdf,1992
A Connectionist Symbol Manipulator,"We present a neural net architecture that can discover hierarchical and re cursive structure in symbol strings. To detect structure at multiple levels, the architecture has the capability of reducing symbols substrings to single symbols, and makes use of an external stack memory. In terms of formal languages, the architecture can learn to parse strings in an LR(O) context free grammar. Given training sets of positive and negative exemplars, the architecture has been trained to recognize many different grammars. The architecture has only one layer of modifiable weights, allowing for a straightforward interpretation of its behavior. Many cognitive domains involve complex sequences that contain hierarchical or recursive structure, e.g., music, natural language parsing, event perception.

Analogy--Watershed or Waterloo?,"Neural network models have been criticized for their inability to make use of compositional representations. In this paper, we describe a series of psychological phenomena that demonstrate the role of structured representations in cognition. These findings suggest that people compare relational representations via a process of structural alignment. This process will have to be captured by any model of cognition, symbolic or subsymbolic. 1.0 INTRODUCTION Pattern recognition is central to cognition. At the perceptual level, we notice key features of the world (like symmetry), recognize objects in front of us and identify the letters on a printed page. At a higher level, we recognize problems we have solved before and determine similarities-including analogical similarities-between new situations and old ones.

The model uses a neural network that is initialized with an understanding of geometry similar to that of second-grade children. Through the presentation of a series of examples, the model is shown to develop an understanding of geometry similar to that of fifth-grade children who were trained using similar materials. 1 Introduction One of the principal problems in instructing children is to develop sequences of examples that help children acquire useful concepts. In this endeavor it is often useful to have a model of how children learn the material, for a good model can guide an instructor towards particularly effective examples. In short, good models of learning help a teacher maximize the utility of the example presented.

Integration of Visual and Somatosensory,"The primate brain must solve two important problems in grasping move ments.

The second problem concerns hand shape planning: specifically, how does the brain design the hand configuration suited to the shape of the object and the manipulation task? A neural network model that solves these problems has been developed. The operations of the net work are divided into a learning phase and an optimization phase. In the learning phase, internal representations, which depend on the grasped ob jects and the task, are acquired by integrating visual and somatosensory information. In the optimization phase, the most suitable hand shape for grasping an object is determined by using a relaxation computation of the network. * Present Address: Parallel Distributed Processing Research Dept., Sony Corporation, 6-7-35 Kitashinagawa, Shinagawa-ku, Tok",Computer Vision,53e3a7161e428b65688f14b84d61c610-Paper.pdf,1992
Kohonen Feature Maps and Growing,"A performance comparison of two self-organizing networks, the Ko honen Feature Map and the recently proposed Growing Cell Struc tures is made. For this purpose several performance criteria for self-organizing networks are proposed and motivated. The models are tested with three example problems of increasing difficulty. The Kohonen Feature Map demonstrates slightly superior results only for the simplest problem. For the other more difficult and also more realistic problems the Growing Cell Structures exhibit significantly better performance by every criterion. Additional advantages of the new model are that all parameters are constant over time and that size as well as structure of the network are determined auto matically. 1 INTRODUCTION Self-organizing networks are able to generate interesting low-dimensional represen tations of high-dimensional input data.

A Neural Model of Descending Gain,"In the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish, descending pathways to a first-order sensory nucleus have been shown to influ ence the gain of its output neurons. The underlying neural mecha nisms that subserve this descending gain control capability are not yet fully understood. We suggest that one possible gain control mechanism could involve the regulation of total membrane conduc tance of the output neurons. In this paper, a neural model based on this idea is used to demonstrate how activity levels on descend ing pathways could control both the gain and baseline excitation of a target neuron. 1 INTRODUCTION Certain species of freshwater tropical fish, known as weakly electric fish, possess an active electric sense that allows them to detect and discriminate objects in their environment using a self-generated electric field (Bullock and Heiligenberg, 1986).

Learning Fuzzy Rule-Based Neural,"A three-step method for function approximation with a fuzzy sys tem is proposed. First, the membership functions and an initial rule representation are learned; second, the rules are compressed as much as possible using information theory; and finally, a com putational network is constructed to compute the function value. This system is applied to two control examples: learning the truck and trailer backer-upper control system, and learning a cruise con trol system for a radio-controlled model car. 1 Introduction Function approximation is the problem of estimating a function from a set of ex amples of its independent variables and function value. If there is prior knowledge of the type of function being learned, a mathematical model of the function can be constructed and the parameters perturbed until the best match is achieved.

The objective of this effort is to develop an adaptive Neural Network (NN) controller for the Ball C-Side 1m x 3m antenna with embedded actuators and the RAMS sensor system.

On-line training of recurrent and feed-forward NN architectures have achieved adaptive vibration control with unknown modal variations and noisy measurements. On-line training feedback to each actuator NN output is computed via Newton's method to reduce the difference between desired and achieved antenna positions. 1 ADAPTIVE CONTROL BACKGROUND The two traditional approaches to adaptive control are 1) direct control (such as perfonned in direct model reference adaptive controllers) and 2) indirect control (such as performed by explicit self-tuning r",Reinforcement Learning,58d4d1e7b1e97b258c9ed0b37e02d087-Paper.pdf,1992
Hidden Markov Model Induction by Bayesian,"This paper describes a technique for learning both the number of states and the topology of Hidden Markov Models from examples. The induction process starts with the most specific model consistent with the training data and generalizes by successively merging states. Both the choice of states to merge and the stopping criterion are guided by the Bayesian posterior probability. We compare our algorithm with the Baum-Welch method of estimating fixed-size models, and find that it can induce minimal HMMs from data in cases where fixed estimation does not converge or requires redundant parameters to converge. 1 INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are a well-studied approach to the modelling of sequence data. HMMs can be viewed as a stochastic generalization of finite-state automata, where both the transitions between states and the generation of output symbols are governed by probability distributions.

Statistical Mechanics of Learning Iâ¢ n a,"We use statistical mechanics to study generalization in large com mittee machines. For an architecture with nonoverlapping recep tive fields a replica calculation yields the generalization error in the limit of a large number of hidden units. For continuous weights the generalization error falls off asymptotically inversely proportional to the number of training examples per weight. For binary Q, weights we find a discontinuous transition from poor to perfect generalization followed by a wide region of metastability. Broken replica symmetry is found within this region at low temperatures. For a fully connected architecture the generalization error is cal culated within the annealed approximation. For both binary and continuous weights we find transitions from a symmetric state to one with specialized hidden units, accompanied by discontinuous drops in the generalization error. 1 Introduction There has been a good deal of theoretical work on calcula.ting the generalization ability of ne",Optimization & Theoretical ML,5d44ee6f2c3f71b73125876103c8f6c4-Paper.pdf,1992
An Information-Theoretic Approach to,"Information theory is used to derive a simple formula for the amount of information conveyed by the firing rate of a neuron about any experimentally measured variable or combination of variables (e.g. running speed, head direction, location of the animal, etc.). The derivation treats the cell as a communication channel whose input is the measured variable and whose output is the cell's spike train. Applying the formula, we find systematic differences in the information content of hippocampal ""place cells"" in different ex perimental conditions. 1 INTRODUCTION Almost any neuron will respond to some manipulation or other by changing its firing rate, and this change in firing can convey information to downstream neurons.

The firing of CAl place cells is simulated as the (artificial) rat moves in an en vironment. This is the input for a neuronal network whose output, at each theta (0) cycle, is the next direction of travel for the rat. Cells are characterised by the number of spikes fired and the time of firing with respect to hippocampal 0 rhythm. 'Learning' occurs in 'on-off' synapses that are switched on by simultaneous pre- and post-synaptic activity. The simulated rat navigates successfully to goals encountered one or more times during exploration in open fields.

Learning Sequential Tasks by,"An incremental, higher-order, non-recurrent network combines two properties found to be useful for learning sequential tasks: higher order connections and incremental introduction of new units. The network adds higher orders when needed by adding new units that dynamically modify connection weights. Since the new units mod ify the weights at the next time-step with information from the previous step, temporal tasks can be learned without the use of feedback, thereby greatly simplifying training. Furthermore, a the oretically unlimited number of units can be added to reach into the arbitrarily distant past.

Our results in dicate that to bring the potential of large networks to bear on the problem of extracting information from small data sets without run ning the risk of overjitting, deeply cascaded network architectures are more favorable than shallow broad architectures that contain the same number of nodes. 1 Introduction For many real-world applications, a major constraint for the successful learning from examples is the limited number of examples available. Thus, methods are required, that can learn from small data sets. This constraint makes the problem of generalization particularly hard.

Explanation-Based Neural Network Learning,"How can artificial neural nets generalize better from fewer examples? In order to generalize successfully, neural network learning methods typically require large training data sets. We introduce a neural network learning method that generalizes rationally from many fewer data points, relying instead on prior knowledge encoded in previously learned neural networks. For example, in robot control learning tasks reported here, previously learned networks that model the effects of robot actions are used to guide subsequent learning of robot control functions. For each observed training example of the target function (e.g. the robot control policy), the learner explains the observed example in terms of its prior knowledge, then analyzes this explanation to infer additional information about the shape, or slope, of the target function. This shape knowledge is used to bias generalization when learning the target function. Results are presented applying this approach to a simulated robot task ",Deep Learning,851ddf5058cf22df63d3344ad89919cf-Paper.pdf,1992
Some Solutions to the Missing Feature Problem,"In visual processing the ability to deal with missing and noisy informa tion is crucial. Occlusions and unreliable feature detectors often lead to situations where little or no direct information about features is availa ble. However the available information is usually sufficient to highly constrain the outputs. We discuss Bayesian techniques for extracting class probabilities given partial data. The optimal solution involves inte grating over the missing dimensions weighted by the local probability densities. We show how to obtain closed-form approximations to the Bayesian solution using Gaussian basis function networks. The frame work extends naturally to the case of noisy features. Simulations on a complex task (3D hand gesture recognition) validate the theory. When both integration and weighting by input densities are used, performance decreases gracefully with the number of missing or noisy features. Per formance is substantially degraded if either step is omitted. 1 INTRODUCTION",Computer Vision,85fc37b18c57097425b52fc7afbb6969-Paper.pdf,1992
A Note on Learning Vector Quantization,"Vector Quantization is useful for data compression. Competitive Learn ing which minimizes reconstruction error is an appropriate algorithm for vector quantization of unlabelled data. Vector quantization of labelled data for classification has a different objective, to minimize the number of misclassifications, and a different algorithm is appropriate. We show that a variant of Kohonen's LVQ2.1 algorithm can be seen as a multi class extension of an algorithm which in a restricted 2 class case can be proven to converge to the Bayes optimal classification boundary. We compare the performance of the LVQ2.1 algorithm to that of a modified version having a decreasing window and normalized step size, on a ten class vowel classification problem. 1 Introduction Vector quantization is a form of data compression that represents data vectors by a smaller set of codebook vectors. Each data vector is then represented by its nearest codebook vector. The goal of vector quantization is to represent the",Reinforcement Learning,8757150decbd89b0f5442ca3db4d0e0e-Paper.pdf,1992
Diffusion Approximations for the,"In this paper we discuss the asymptotic properties of the most com monly used variant of the backpropagation algorithm in which net work weights are trained by means of a local gradient descent on ex amples drawn randomly from a fixed training set, and the learning rate TJ of the gradient updates is held constant (simple backpropa gation). Using stochastic approximation results, we show that for TJ ~ 0 this training process approaches a batch training and pro vide results on the rate of convergence. Further, we show that for small TJ one can approximate simple back propagation by the sum of a batch training process and a Gaussian diffusion which is the unique solution to a linear stochastic differential equation. Using this approximation we indicate the reasons why simple backprop agation is less likely to get stuck in local minima than the batch training process and demonstrate this empirically on a number of examples. 1 INTRODUCTION The original (simple) backpropagation algorithm, in",Optimization & Theoretical ML,884d247c6f65a96a7da4d1105d584ddd-Paper.pdf,1992
Analog Cochlear Model for Multiresolution,"This paper discusses the parameterization of speech by an analog cochlear model. The tradeoff between time and frequency resolution is viewed as the fundamental difference between conventional spectrographic analysis and cochlear signal processing for broadband, rapid-changing signals. The model's response exhibits a wavelet-like analysis in the scale domain that preserves good temporal resolution; the frequency of each spectral compo nent in a broadband signal can be accurately determined from the inter peak intervals in the instantaneous firing rates of auditory fibers. Such properties of the cochlear model are demonstrated with natural speech and synthetic complex signals. 1 Introduction As a non-parametric tool, spectrogram, or short-term Fourier transform, is widely used in analyzing non-stationary signals, such speech. Usually a window is applied to the running signal and then the Fourier transform is performed.

A Boundary Hunting Radial Basis Function,"A new boundary hunting radial basis function (BH-RBF) classifier which allocates RBF centers constructively near class boundaries is described. This classifier creates complex decision boundaries only in regions where confusions occur and corresponding RBF outputs are similar. A predicted square error measure is used to determine how many centers to add and to determine when to stop adding centers. Two experiments are presented which demonstrate the advantages of the BH RBF classifier. One uses artificial data with two classes and two input features where each class contains four clusters but only one cluster is near a decision region boundary. The other uses a large seismic database with seven classes and 14 input features. In both experiments the BH RBF classifier provides a lower error rate with fewer centers than are required by more conventional RBF, Gaussian mixture, or MLP classifiers. 1 INTRODUCTION Radial basis function (RBF) classifiers have been successfully applied to many ",Computer Vision,8df707a948fac1b4a0f97aa554886ec8-Paper.pdf,1992
Learning to See Where and What:,"This paper describes an approach to integrated segmentation and recognition of hand-printed characters. The approach, called Saccade, integrates ballistic and corrective saccades (eye movements) with character recognition. A single backpropagation net is trained to make a classification decision on a character centered in its input window, as well as to estimate the distance of the current and next character from the center of the input window. The net learns to accurately estimate these distances regardless of variations in character width, spacing between characters, writing style and other factors. During testing, the system uses the net~xtracted classification and distance information, along with a set of jumping rules, to jump from character to character.

How Oscillatory Neuronal Responses Reflect,"A switching between apparently coherent (oscillatory) and stochastic episodes of activity has been observed in responses from cat and monkey visual cortex. We describe the dynamics of these phenomena in two paral lel approaches, a phenomenological and a rather microscopic one. On the one hand we analyze neuronal responses in terms of a hidden state model (HSM). The parameters of this model are extracted directly from exper imental spike trains. They characterize the underlying dynamics as well as the coupling of individual neurons to the network. This phenomenolog ical model thus provides a new framework for the experimental analysis of network dynamics. The application of this method to multi unit ac tivities from the visual cortex of the cat substantiates the existence of oscillatory and stochastic states and quantifies the switching behaviour in the assembly dynamics. On the other hand we start from the single spiking neuron and derive a master equation for the time evolution of the",NLP,8fecb20817b3847419bb3de39a609afe-Paper.pdf,1992
Summed Weight Neuron Perturbation: An O(N),"The algorithm presented performs gradient descent on the weight space of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), using a finite difference to approximate the gradient The method is novel in that it achieves a com putational complexity similar to that of Node Perturbation, O(N3), but does not require access to the activity of hidden or internal neurons. This is possible due to a stochastic relation between perturbations at the weights and the neurons of an ANN. The algorithm is also similar to Weight Perturbation in that it is optimal in terms of hardware require ments when used for the training ofVLSI implementations of ANN's. 1 INTRODUCTION Optimization of the weights of an ANN may be performed by, the application of a gradi ent descent teclmique.

Extended Regularization Methods for,"Many techniques for model selection in the field of neural networks correspond to well established statistical methods. The method of 'stopped training', on the other hand, in which an oversized network is trained until the error on a further validation set of ex amples deteriorates, then training is stopped, is a true innovation, since model selection doesn't require convergence of the training process. In this paper we show that this performance can be significantly enhanced by extending the 'non convergent model selection method' of stopped training to include dynamic topology modifications (dynamic weight pruning) and modified complexity penalty term methods in which the weighting of the penalty term is adjusted during the training process. 1 INTRODUCTION One of the central topics in the field of neural networks is that of model selection.

We show how a discrete-time recurrent ""Elman"" network architecture can be constructed from recurrently connected oscillatory associative memory modules described by continuous nonlinear ordinary dif ferential equations. The modules can learn connection weights be tween themselves which will cause the system to evolve under a clocked ""machine cycle"" by a sequence of transitions of attractors within the modules, much as a digital computer evolves by transi tions of its binary flip-flop attractors.

The architecture we investigate is composed of RBF units on a lat tice, which imposes flexible constraints on the parameters of the network. Virtues of this approach include variable subset selec tion, robust parameter selection, multiresolution processing, and interpolation of sparse training data. 1 INTRODUCTION Generalization performance on a fixed-size training set is closely related to the number of free parameters in a network.

A Hybrid Linear/Nonlinear Approach to Channel,"Channel equalization problem is an important problem in high-speed communications. The sequences of symbols transmitted are distorted by neighboring symbols. Traditionally, the channel equalization problem is considered as a channel-inversion operation.

In this paper, the optimal equalizer design is formulated as a classification problem. The optimal classifier can be constructed by Bayes decision rule. In general it is nonlinear. An efficient hybrid linear/nonlinear equalizer approach has been proposed to train the equalizer.

A Practice Strategy for Robot Learning,"""Trajectory Extension Learning"" is a new technique for Learning Control in Robots which assumes that there exists some parameter of the desired trajectory that can be smoothly varied from a region of easy solvability of the dynamics to a region of desired behavior which may have more difficult dynamics. By gradually varying the parameter, practice movements remain near the desired path while a Neural Network learns to approximate the inverse dynamics. For example, the average speed of motion might be varied, and the in verse dynamics can be ""bootstrapped"" from slow movements with simpler dynamics to fast movements. This provides an example of the more general concept of a ""Practice Strategy"" in which a se quence of intermediate tasks is used to simplify learning a complex task.

Optimal Depth Neural Networks for Multiplication,"An artificial neural network (ANN) is commonly modeled by a threshold circuit, a network of interconnected processing units called linear threshold gates. The depth of a network represents the number of unit delays or the time for parallel computation. The SIze of a circuit is the number of gates and measures the amount of hardware.

Nets with Unreliable Hidden Nodes Learn,"In a multi-layered neural network, anyone of the hidden layers can be viewed as computing a distributed representation of the input. Several ""encoder"" experiments have shown that when the representation space is small it can be fully used. But computing with such a representation requires completely dependable nodes. In the case where the hidden nodes are noisy and unreliable, we find that error correcting schemes emerge simply by using noisy units during training; random errors in jected during backpropagation result in spreading representations apart. Average and minimum distances increase with misfire probability, as predicted by coding-theoretic considerations. Furthennore, the effect of this noise is to protect the machine against permanent node failure, thereby potentially extending the useful lifetime of the machine. 1 INTRODUCTION The encoder task described by Ackley, Hinton, and Sejnowski (1985) for the Boltzmann machine, and by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams (1986) for feed-",Optimization & Theoretical ML,c361bc7b2c033a83d663b8d9fb4be56e-Paper.pdf,1992
Unsmearing Vistlal Motion:,"Human VlSlon systems integrate information nonlocally, across long spatial ranges. For example, a moving stimulus appears smeared when viewed briefly (30 ms), yet sharp when viewed for a longer exposure (100 ms) (Burr, 1980). This suggests that visual systems combine information along a trajectory that matches the motion of the stimulus. Our self-organizing neural network model shows how developmental exposure to moving stimuli can direct the formation of horizontal trajectory-specific motion integration pathways that unsmear representations of moving stimuli. These results account for Burr's data and can potentially also model ot.her phenomena, such as visual inertia. 1 INTRODUCTION N onlocal interactions strongly influence the processing of visual motion information and the response characteristics of visual neurons.

Filter Selection Model for Generating,"Neurons in area MT of primate visual cortex encode the velocity of moving objects. We present a model of how MT cells aggregate responses from VI to form such a velocity representation. Two different sets of units, with local receptive fields, receive inputs from motion energy filters. One set of units forms estimates of local motion, while the second set computes the utility of these estimates. Outputs from this second set of units ""gate"" the outputs from the first set through a gain control mechanism. This active process for selecting only a subset of local motion responses to integrate into more global responses distinguishes our model from previous models of velocity estimation. The model yields accurate velocity estimates in synthetic images containing multiple moving targets of varying size, luminance, and spatial frequency profile and deals well with a number of transparency phenomena. 1 INTRODUCTION Humans, and primates in general, are very good at complex motion processing tas",Computer Vision,ca9c267dad0305d1a6308d2a0cf1c39c-Paper.pdf,1992
N on-Linear Dimensionality Reduction,"A method for creating a non-linear encoder-decoder for multidimensional data with compact representations is presented. The commonly used technique of autoassociation is extended to allow non-linear representations, and an objec tive function which penalizes activations of individual hidden units is shown to result in minimum dimensional encodings with respect to allowable error in reconstruction. 1 INTRODUCTION Reducing dimensionality of data with minimal information loss is important for feature extraction, compact coding and computational efficiency. The data can be tranformed into ""good"" representations for further processing, constraints among feature variables may be identified, and redundancy eliminated. Many algorithms are exponential in the dimensionality of the input, thus even reduction by a single dimension may provide valuable computational savings.

Feudal Reinforcement Learning,"One way to speed up reinforcement learning is to enable learning to happen simultaneously at multiple resolutions in space and time. This paper shows how to create a Q-Iearning managerial hierarchy in which high level managers learn how to set tasks to their sub managers who, in turn, learn how to satisfy them. Sub-managers need not initially understand their managers' commands. They simply learn to maximise their reinforcement in the context of the current command. We illustrate the system using a simple maze task .. As the system learns how to get around, satisfying commands at the multiple levels, it explores more efficiently than standard, flat, Q-Iearning and builds a more comprehensive map. 1 INTRODUCTION Straightforward reinforcement learning has been quite successful at some rela tively complex tasks like playing backgammon (Tesauro, 1992).

The levels of learning achieved with and without weight sharing for different automata provide new insight into their dynamics. 1 INTRODUCTION Neural networks have been shown to be capable of learning the dynamical behaviour exhibited by chaotic time series composed of measurements of a single variable among many in a complex system [1, 2, 3].

The representations are success fully applied to word sense disambiguation using a nearest neighbor method. 1 Introduction Many tasks in natural language processing require access to semantic information about lexical items and text segments. For example, a system processing the sound sequence: /rE.k~maisbi:tJ/ needs to know the topic of the discourse in order to decide which of the plausible hypotheses for analysis is the right one: e.g. ""wreck a nice beach"" or ""recognize speech"".

Destabilization and Route to Chaos,"The occurence of chaos in recurrent neural networks is supposed to depend on the architecture and on the synaptic coupling strength. It is studied here for a randomly diluted architecture. By normalizing the variance of synaptic weights, we produce a bifurcation parameter, dependent on this variance and on the slope of the transfer function but independent of the connectivity, that allows a sustained activity and the occurence of chaos when reaching a critical value. Even for weak connectivity and small size, we find numerical results in accordance with the theoretical ones previously established for fully connected infinite sized networks. Moreover the route towards chaos is numerically checked to be a quasi-periodic one, whatever the type of the first bifurcation is (Hopf bifurcation, pitchfork or flip). 549 550 Doyon, Cessac, Quoy, and Samuelides 1 INTRODUCTION Most part of studies on recurrent neural networks assume sufficient conditions of convergence.

The input strings consist of a time ordered sequence of X-Y coordinates, punctuated by pen-lifts. The methods were designed to work in ""run-on mode"" where there is no constraint on the spacing between characters. While both methods use a neural network recognition engine and a graph-algorithmic post-processor, their approaches to segmentation are quite differ ent. The first method, which we call IN SEC (for input segmen tation), uses a combination of heuristics to identify particular pen lifts as tentative segmentation points.

On the Use of Evidence in Neural Networks,"The Bayesian ""evidence"" approximation has recently been employed to determine the noise and weight-penalty terms used in back-propagation. This paper shows that for neural nets it is far easier to use the exact result than it is to use the evidence approximation. Moreover, unlike the evi dence approximation, the exact result neither has to be re-calculated for every new data set, nor requires the running of computer code (the exact result is closed form). In addition, it turns out that the evidence proce dure's MAP estimate for neural nets is, in toto, approximation error. An other advantage of the exact analysis is that it does not lead one to incor rect intuition, like the claim that using evidence one can ""evaluate differ ent priors in light of the data"".

Automatic Capacity Tuning,"Large VC-dimension classifiers can learn difficult tasks, but are usually impractical because they generalize well only if they are trained with huge quantities of data. In this paper we show that even high-order polynomial classifiers in high dimensional spaces can be trained with a small amount of training data and yet generalize better than classifiers with a smaller VC-dimension. This is achieved with a maximum margin algorithm (the Generalized Portrait). The technique is applicable to a wide variety of classifiers, including Perceptrons, polynomial classifiers (sigma-pi unit net works) and Radial Basis Functions. The effective number of parameters is adjusted automatically by the training algorithm to match the complexity of the problem.

The Power of Amnesia,"We propose a learning algorithm for a variable memory length Markov process. Human communication, whether given as text, handwriting, or speech, has multi characteristic time scales. On short scales it is characterized mostly by the dynamics that gen erate the process, whereas on large scales, more syntactic and se mantic information is carried. For that reason the conventionally used fixed memory Markov models cannot capture effectively the complexity of such structures. On the other hand using long mem ory models uniformly is not practical even for as short memory as four. The algorithm we propose is based on minimizing the sta tistical prediction error by extending the memory, or state length, adaptively, until the total prediction error is sufficiently small.

Empirical results on two real-world problems sub stantiate the faster learning speed; when applied to the training of a recurrent network on a well researched sequence recognition task (the Reber grammar), training times are significantly less than previously reported. 1 Introduction Selecting the optimal network architecture for a specific application is a nontrivial task, and several algorithms have been proposed to automate this process.

A Local Algorithm to Learn Trajectories,"This paper presents a simple algorithm to learn trajectories with a continuous time, continuous activation version of the Boltzmann machine. The algorithm takes advantage of intrinsic Brownian noise in the network to easily compute gradients using entirely local computations. The algorithm may be ideal for parallel hardware implementations. This paper presents a learning algorithm to train continuous stochastic networks to respond with desired trajectories in the output units to environmental input trajectories. This is a task, with potential applications to a variety of problems such as stochastic modeling of neural processes, artificial motor control, and continuous speech recognition. For example, in a continuous speech recognition problem, the input trajectory may be a sequence of fast Fourier transform coefficients, and the output a likely trajectory of phonemic patterns corresponding to the input.

Use of Bad Training Data For Better,"We show how randomly scrambling the output classes of various fractions of the training data may be used to improve predictive accuracy of a classification algorithm. We present a method for calculating the ""noise sensitivity signature"" of a learning algorithm which is based on scrambling the output classes. This signature can be used to indicate a good match between the complexity of the classifier and the complexity of the data. Use of noise sensitivity signatures is distinctly different from other schemes to avoid over training, such as cross-validation, which uses only part of the train ing data, or various penalty functions, which are not data-adaptive. Noise sensitivity signature methods use all of the training data and are manifestly data-adaptive and non-parametric. They are well suited for situations with limited training data. 1 INTRODUCTION A major problem of pattern recognition and classification algorithms that learn from a training set of examples is to select the complex",Optimization & Theoretical ML,1905aedab9bf2477edc068a355bba31a-Paper.pdf,1993
Non-Intrusive Gaze Tracking Using Artificial,"We have developed an artificial neural network based gaze tracking system which can be customized to individual users. Unlike other gaze trackers, which normally require the user to wear cumbersome headgear, or to use a chin rest to ensure head immobility, our system is entirely non-intrusive. Currently, the best intrusive gaze tracking systems are accurate to approxi mately 0.75 degrees. In our experiments, we have been able to achieve an accuracy of 1.5 degrees, while allowing head mobility. In this paper we present an empirical analysis of the performance of a large number of artifi cial neural network architectures for this task. 1 INTRODUCTION The goal of gaze tracking is to determine where a subject is looking from the appearance of the subject's eye.

How to Describe Neuronal Activity:,"What is the 'correct' theoretical description of neuronal activity? The analysis of the dynamics of a globally connected network of spiking neurons (the Spike Response Model) shows that a descrip tion by mean firing rates is possible only if active neurons fire in coherently. If firing occurs coherently or with spatio-temporal cor relations, the spike structure of the neural code becomes relevant. Alternatively, neurons can be gathered into local or distributed en sembles or 'assemblies'. A description based on the mean ensemble activity is, in principle, possible but the interaction between differ ent assemblies becomes highly nonlinear. A description with spikes should therefore be preferred. 1 INTRODUCTION Neurons communicate by sequences of short pulses, the so-called action potentials or spikes. One of the most important problems in theoretical neuroscience concerns the question of how information on the environment is encoded in such spike trains: Is the exact timing of spikes wi",NLP,1efa39bcaec6f3900149160693694536-Paper.pdf,1993

Each chip has 32 neural processors and 4 weight update processors, supporting an arbitrary topology of up to 160 functional neurons. On-chip learning is at a theoretical maximum rate of 3.5 x 108 con nection updates/sec; recall is 12000 patterns/sec for typical condi tions.

The approach is applicable to non-rigid models, allows nonlinear perspective transformations, and can op timally deal with occlusions and missing features.

"Signature Verification using a ""Siamese""","This paper describes an algorithm for verification of signatures written on a pen-input tablet. The algorithm is based on a novel, artificial neural network, called a ""Siamese"" neural network. This network consists of two identical sub-networks joined at their out puts. During training the two sub-networks extract features from two signatures, while the joining neuron measures the distance be tween the two feature vectors. Verification consists of comparing an extracted feature vector ~ith a stored feature vector for the signer.

Connectionism for Music and Audition,"This workshop explored machine learning approaches to 3 topics: (1) finding structure in music (analysis, continuation, and comple tion of an unfinished piece), (2) modeling perception of time (ex traction of musical meter, explanation of human data on timing), and (3) interpolation in timbre space. In recent years, NIPS has heard neural networks generate tunes and harmonize chorales. With a large amount of music becoming available in computer readable form, real data can be used to train connectionist models. At the beginning of this workshop, Andreas Weigend focused on architectures to capture structure on multiple time scales. J. S.

Event-Driven Simulation of Networks of,"A fast event-driven software simulator has been developed for sim ulating large networks of spiking neurons and synapses. The prim itive network elements are designed to exhibit biologically realis tic behaviors, such as spiking, refractoriness, adaptation, axonal delays, summation of post-synaptic current pulses, and tonic cur rent inputs. The efficient event-driven representation allows large networks to be simulated in a fraction of the time that would be required for a full compartmental-model simulation.

The time steps (ma chine cycles) of the system are implemented by rhythmic variation (clocking) of a bifurcation parameter. In this architecture, oscilla tion amplitude codes the information content or activity of a mod ule (unit), whereas phase and frequency are used to ""softwire"" the network.

Robust Parameter Estimation And,"In this paper, it is shown that the conventional back-propagation (BPP) algorithm for neural network regression is robust to lever ages (data with :n corrupted), but not to outliers (data with y corrupted). A robust model is to model the error as a mixture of normal distribution. The influence function for this mixture model is calculated and the condition for the model to be robust to outliers is given. EM algorithm [5] is used to estimate the parameter.

Computational Elements of the Adaptive,"We consider the problem of how the CNS learns to control dynam ics of a mechanical system. By using a paradigm where a subject's hand interacts with a virtual mechanical environment, we show that learning control is via composition of a model of the imposed dynamics. Some properties of the computational elements with which the CNS composes this model are inferred through the gen eralization capabilities of the subject outside the training data. 1 Introduction At about the age of three months, children become interested in tactile exploration of objects around them. They attempt to reach for an object, but often fail to properly control their arm and end up missing their target. In the ensuing weeks, they rapidly improve and soon they can not only reach accurately, they can also pick up the object and place it.

Transition Point Dynamic Programming,"Transition point dynamic programming (TPDP) is a memory based, reinforcement learning, direct dynamic programming ap proach to adaptive optimal control that can reduce the learning time and memory usage required for the control of continuous stochastic dynamic systems. TPDP does so by determining an ideal set of transition points (TPs) which specify only the control action changes necessary for optimal control. TPDP converges to an ideal TP set by using a variation of Q-Iearning to assess the mer its of adding, swapping and removing TPs from states throughout the state space. When applied to a race track problem, TPDP learned the optimal control policy much sooner than conventional Q-Iearning, and was able to do so using less memory. 1 INTRODUCTION Dynamic programming (DP) approaches can be utilized to determine optimal con trol policies for continuous stochastic dynamic systems when the state spaces of those systems have been quantized with a resolution suitable for control (Barto et ",Reinforcement Learning,362e80d4df43b03ae6d3f8540cd63626-Paper.pdf,1993
Monte Carlo Matrix Inversion and,"We describe the relationship between certain reinforcement learn ing (RL) methods based on dynamic programming (DP) and a class of unorthodox Monte Carlo methods for solving systems of linear equations proposed in the 1950's. These methods recast the solu tion of the linear system as the expected value of a statistic suitably defined over sample paths of a Markov chain. The significance of our observations lies in arguments (Curtiss, 1954) that these Monte Carlo methods scale better with respect to state-space size than do standard, iterative techniques for solving systems of linear equa tions. This analysis also establishes convergence rate estimates. Because methods used in RL systems for approximating the evalu ation function of a fixed control policy also approximate solutions to systems of linear equations, the connection to these Monte Carlo methods establishes that algorithms very similar to TD algorithms (Sutton, 1988) are asymptotically more efficient in a precise sense than o",Reinforcement Learning,3b3dbaf68507998acd6a5a5254ab2d76-Paper.pdf,1993

Robust Reinforcement Learning â¢,"While exploring to find better solutions, an agent performing on line reinforcement learning (RL) can perform worse than is accept able. In some cases, exploration might have unsafe, or even catas trophic, results, often modeled in terms of reaching 'failure' states of the agent's environment. This paper presents a method that uses domain knowledge to reduce the number of failures during explo ration. This method formulates the set of actions from which the RL agent composes a control policy to ensure that exploration is conducted in a policy space that excludes most of the unacceptable policies. The resulting action set has a more abstract relationship to the task being solved than is common in many applications of RL.

Exploiting Chaos to Control the Future,"Recently, Ott, Grebogi and Yorke (OGY) [6] found an effective method to control chaotic systems to unstable fixed points by us ing only small control forces; however, OGY's method is based on and limited to a linear theory and requires considerable knowledge of the dynamics of the system to be controlled. In this paper we use two radial basis function networks: one as a model of an unknown plant and the other as the controller. The controller is trained with a recurrent learning algorithm to minimize a novel objective function such that the controller can locate an unstable fixed point and drive the system into the fixed point with no a priori knowl edge of the system dynamics. Our results indicate that the neural controller offers many advantages over OGY's technique. 1 Introduction Recently, Ott, Grebogi and Yorke (OGY) [6] proposed a simple but very good idea.

Two Iterative Algorithms for Computing,"The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is an important tool for linear algebra and can be used to invert or approximate matrices.

This property is important for applications to signal transmission and control. I propose two new algorithms for iterative computation of the SVD given only sample inputs and outputs from a matrix.

Efficient Computation of Complex,"By their very nature, memory based algorithms such as KNN or Parzen windows require a computationally expensive search of a large database of prototypes.

The closest prototypes are found by recursively searching included subset.s of the database using dis tances of increasing complexit.y. This is done by using a hierarchy of tangent distances (increasing the Humber of tangent. vectors from o to its maximum) and multiresolution (using wavelets). At each stage, a confidence level of the classification is computed. If the confidence is high enough, the c.omputation of more complex dis tances is avoided. The resulting algorithm applied to character recognition is close to t.hree orders of magnitude faster than com puting the full tangent dist.ance on every prot.ot.ypes. 1 INTRODUCTION Memory based algorithms such as KNN or Parzen windows have been extensively",Computer Vision,4b0a59ddf11c58e7446c9df0da541a84-Paper.pdf,1993
Statistics of Natural Images:,"In order to best understand a visual system one should attempt to characterize the natural images it processes. We gather images from the woods and find that these scenes possess an ensemble scale invariance. Further, they are highly non-Gaussian, and this non Gaussian character cannot be removed through local linear filter ing. We find that including a simple ""gain control"" nonlinearity in the filtering process makes the filter output quite Gaussian, mean ing information is maximized at fixed channel variance. Finally, we use the measured power spectrum to place an upper bound on the information conveyed about natural scenes by an array of receptors. 1 Introduction Natural stimuli are playing an increasingly important role in our understanding of sensory processing. This is because a sensory system's ability to perform a task is a statistical quantity which depends on the signal and noise characteristics.

GDS: Gradient Descent Generation of,"Imagine you have designed a neural network that successfully learns a complex classification task. What are the relevant input features the classifier relies on and how are these features combined to pro duce the classification decisions? There are applications where a deeper insight into the structure of an adaptive system and thus into the underlying classification problem may well be as important as the system's performance characteristics, e.g. in economics or medicine. GDSi is a backpropagation-based training scheme that produces networks transformable into an equivalent and concise set of IF-THEN rules. This is achieved by imposing penalty terms on the network parameters that adapt the network to the expressive power of this class of rules. Thus during training we simultaneously minimize classification and transformation error. Some real-world tasks demonstrate the viability of our approach. 1 Introduction This paper deals with backpropagation networks trained to perform a classi",NLP,4e0928de075538c593fbdabb0c5ef2c3-Paper.pdf,1993
Packet Routing in Dynamically,"This paper describes the Q-routing algorithm for packet routing, in which a reinforcement learning module is embedded into each node of a switching network. Only local communication is used by each node to keep accurate statistics on which routing decisions lead to minimal delivery times. In simple experiments involving a 36-node, irregularly connected network, Q-routing proves supe rior to a nonadaptive algorithm based on precomputed shortest paths and is able to route efficiently even when critical aspects of the simulation, such as the network load, are allowed to vary dy namically. The paper concludes with a discussion of the tradeoff between discovering shortcuts and maintaining stable policies. 1 INTRODUCTION The field of reinforcement learning has grown dramatically over the past several years, but with the exception of backgammon [8, 2], has had few successful appli cations to large-scale, practical tasks.

How to Choose an Activation Function,"We study the complexity problem in artificial feedforward neural networks designed to approximate real valued functions of several real variables; i.e., we estimate the number of neurons in a network required to ensure a given degree of approximation to every function in a given function class. We indicate how to construct networks with the indicated number of neurons evaluating standard activation functions. Our general theorem shows that the smoother the activation function, the better the rate of approximation. 1 INTRODUCTION The approximation capabilities of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer has been studied by many authors, e.g., [1, 2, 5].

Efficient Simulation of Biological Neural,"We present a neural network simulation which we implemented on the massively parallel Connection Machine 2. In contrast to previous work, this simulator is based on biologically realistic neu rons with nontrivial single-cell dynamics, high connectivity with a structure modelled in agreement with biological data, and preser vation of the temporal dynamics of spike interactions. We simulate neural networks of 16,384 neurons coupled by about 1000 synapses per neuron, and estimate the performance for much larger systems. Communication between neurons is identified as the computation ally most demanding task and we present a novel method to over come this bottleneck. The simulator has already been used to study the primary visual system of the cat. 1 INTRODUCTION Neural networks have been implemented previously on massively parallel supercom puters (Fujimoto et al., 1992, Zhang et al., 1990).

Convergence of Stochastic Iterative,"Increasing attention has recently been paid to algorithms based on dynamic programming (DP) due to the suitability of DP for learn ing problems involving control. In stochastic environments where the system being controlled is only incompletely known, however, a unifying theoretical account of these methods has been missing. In this paper we relate DP-based learning algorithms to the pow erful techniques of stochastic approximation via a new convergence theorem, enabling us to establish a class of convergent algorithms to which both TD(""\) and Q-Iearning belong. 1 INTRODUCTION Learning to predict the future and to find an optimal way of controlling it are the basic goals of learning systems that interact with their environment.

An Analog VLSI Model of Central Pattern,"I detail the design and construction of an analog VLSI model of the neural system responsible for swimming behaviors of the leech. Why the leech? The biological network is small and relatively well understood, and the silicon model can therefore span three levels of organization in the leech nervous system (neuron, ganglion, system); it represents one of the first comprehensive models of leech swimming operating in real-time. The circuit employs biophysically motivated analog neurons networked to form multiple biologically inspired silicon ganglia. These ganglia are coupled using known interganglionic connections. Thus the model retains the flavor of its biological counterpart, and though simplified, the output of the silicon circuit is similar to the output of the leech swim central pattern generator. The model operates on the same time- and spatial-scale as the leech nervous system and will provide an excellent platform with which to explore real-time adaptive locomotion in the leech",Computer Vision,5c572eca050594c7bc3c36e7e8ab9550-Paper.pdf,1993
Non-linear Statistical Analysis and,"Neurons learning under an unsupervised Hebbian learning rule can perform a nonlinear generalization of principal component analysis. This relationship between nonlinear PCA and nonlinear neurons is reviewed. The stable fixed points of the neuron learning dynamics correspond to the maxima of the statist,ic optimized under non linear PCA. However, in order to predict. what the neuron learns, knowledge of the basins of attractions of the neuron dynamics is required. Here the correspondence between nonlinear PCA and neural networks breaks down. This is shown for a simple model. Methods of statistical mechanics can be used to find the optima of the objective function of non-linear PCA. This determines what the neurons can learn.

Locally Adaptive Nearest Neighbor,"Four versions of a k-nearest neighbor algorithm with locally adap tive k are introduced and compared to the basic k-nearest neigh bor algorithm (kNN). Locally adaptive kNN algorithms choose the value of k that should be used to classify a query by consulting the results of cross-validation computations in the local neighborhood of the query. Local kNN methods are shown to perform similar to kNN in experiments with twelve commonly used data sets. Encour aging results in three constructed tasks show that local methods can significantly outperform kNN in specific applications. Local methods can be recommended for on-line learning and for appli cations where different regions of the input space are covered by patterns solving different sub-tasks. 1 Introduction The k-nearest neighbor algorithm (kNN, Dasarathy, 1991) is one of the most ven erable algorithms in machine learning.

Bayesian Backprop in Action:,"MacKay's Bayesian framework for backpropagation is conceptually appealing as well as practical. It automatically adjusts the weight decay parameters during training, and computes the evidence for each trained network. The evidence is proportional to our belief in the model. The networks with highest evidence turn out to generalise well. In this paper, the framework is extended to pruned nets, leading to an Ockham Factor for ""tuning the architecture to the data"". A committee of networks, selected by their high evidence, is a natural Bayesian construction. The evidence of a committee is computed. The framework is illustrated on real-world data from a near infrared spectrometer used to determine the fat content in minced meat.

A learning algorithm is con structed, by which the optimal parameter can be found without any recursive procedure. The solvable models enable us to analyze the reason why experimental results by the error backpropagation often contradict the statistical learning theory. 1 INTRODUCTION Recent studies have shown that learning in artificial neural networks can be under stood as statistical parametric estimation using t.he maximum likelihood method [1], and that their generalization abilities can be estimated using the statistical asymptotic theory [2].

We describe a modified bumptree structure that has been employed as a neural network classifier, and compare its performance on several classification tasks against that of radial basis function networks and the standard mutIi-Iayer perceptron. 1 INTRODUCTION A number of neural network studies have demonstrated the utility of the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and shown it to be a highly effective paradigm. Studies have also shown, however, that the MLP is not without its problems, in particular it requires an extensive training time, is susceptible to local minima problems and its perfonnance is dependent upon its internal network architecture.

We report face recognition results under drastically changing lighting conditions for a computer vision sys tem which concurrently uses a contrast sensitive silicon retina and a con ventional, gain controlled CCO camera. For both input devices the face recognition system employs an elastic matching algorithm with wavelet based features to classify unknown faces. To assess the effect of analog on -chip preprocessing by the silicon retina the CCO images have been ""digitally preprocessed"" with a bandpass filter to adjust the power spec trum.

Address Block Location with a Neural Net System,"We developed a system for finding address blocks on mail pieces that can process four images per second. Besides locating the address block, our system also determines the writing style, handwritten or machine printed, and moreover, it measures the skew angle of the text lines and cleans noisy images.

Assessing the Quality of Learned Local Models,"An approach is presented to learning high dimensional functions in the case where the learning algorithm can affect the generation of new data. A local modeling algorithm, locally weighted regression, is used to represent the learned function. Architectural parameters of the approach, such as distance metrics, are also localized and become a function of the query point instead of being global. Statistical tests are given for when a local model is good enough and sampling should be moved to a new area. Our methods explicitly deal with the case where prediction accuracy requirements exist during exploration: By gradually shifting a ""center of exploration"" and controlling the speed of the shift with local pre diction accuracy, a goal-directed exploration of state space takes place along the fringes of the current data support until the task goal is achieved.

"Synchronization, oscillations, and","We investigate a model for neural activity that generates long range temporal correlations, 1/f noise, and oscillations in global activity. The model consists of a two-dimensional sheet of leaky integrate and-fire neurons with feedback connectivity consisting of local ex citation and surround inhibition. Each neuron is independently driven by homogeneous external noise. Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, resulting in the formation of ""hotspots"" of activ ity in the network. These localized patterns of excitation appear as clusters that coalesce, disintegrate, or fluctuate in size while si multaneously moving in a random walk constrained by the interac tion with other clusters.

Unlike the standard mixture model, a multiple cause model accounts for ob served data by combining assertions from many hidden causes, each of which can pertain to varying degree to any subset of the observ able dimensions. A crucial issue is the mixing-function for combin ing beliefs from different cluster-centers in order to generate data reconstructions whose errors are minimized both during recognition and learning.

A Hodgkin-Huxley Type Neuron Model,"A gradient descent algorithm for parameter estimation which is similar to those used for continuous-time recurrent neural networks was derived for Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron models. Using mem brane potential trajectories as targets, the parameters (maximal conductances, thresholds and slopes of activation curves, time con stants) were successfully estimated. The algorithm was applied to modeling slow non-spike oscillation of an identified neuron in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion. A model with three ionic currents was trained with experimental data. It revealed a novel role of A-current for slow oscillation below -50 mY. 1 INTRODUCTION Conductance-based neuron models, first formulated by Hodgkin and Huxley [10], are commonly used for describing biophysical mechanisms underlying neuronal be havior.

A Comparison of Dynamic Reposing and,"In drug activity prediction (as in handwritten character recogni tion), the features extracted to describe a training example depend on the pose (location, orientation, etc.) of the example. In hand written character recognition, one of the best techniques for ad dressing this problem is the tangent distance method of Simard, LeCun and Denker (1993). Jain, et al.

Dynamic reposing iteratively learns a neural network and then reposes the examples in an effort to maximize the predicted out put values.

Hoo Optimality Criteria for LMS and,"We have recently shown that the widely known LMS algorithm is an HOO optimal estimator. The HOO criterion has been introduced, initially in the control theory literature, as a means to ensure ro bust performance in the face of model uncertainties and lack of statistical information on the exogenous signals. We extend here our analysis to the nonlinear setting often encountered in neural networks, and show that the backpropagation algorithm is locally HOO optimal. This fact provides a theoretical justification of the widely observed excellent robustness properties of the LMS and backpropagation algorithms. We further discuss some implications of these results. 1 Introduction The LMS algorithm was originally conceived as an approximate recursive procedure that solves the following problem (Widrow and Hoff, 1960): given a sequence of n x 1 input column vectors {hd, and a corresponding sequence of desired scalar responses { d i }, find an estimate of an n x 1 column vector of weights w suc",Optimization & Theoretical ML,71ad16ad2c4d81f348082ff6c4b20768-Paper.pdf,1993

A view-based representation is used to model aspects of the hand relevant to the trained gestures, and is found using an unsupervised clustering technique. We use normalized correlation net works, with dynamic time warping in the temporal domain, as a distance function for unsupervised clustering. Views are computed separably for space and time dimensions; the distributed response of the combination of these units characterizes the input data with a low dimensional repre sentation.

Analysis of Short Term Memories for Neural,"Short term memory is indispensable for the processing of time varying information with artificial neural networks. In this paper a model for linear memories is presented, and ways to include memories in connectionist topologies are discussed.

Recognition-based Segmentation of,"This paper introduces a new recognition-based segmentation ap proach to recognizing on-line cursive handwriting from a database of 10,000 English words. The original input stream of z, y pen coor dinates is encoded as a sequence of uniform stroke descriptions that are processed by six feed-forward neural-networks, each designed to recognize letters of different sizes. Words are then recognized by performing best-first search over the space of all possible segmen tations. Results demonstrate that the method is effective at both writer dependent recognition (1.7% to 15.5% error rate) and writer independent recognition (5.2% to 31.1% error rate). 1 Introduction With the advent of pen-based computers, the problem of automatically recognizing handwriting from the motions of a pen has gained much significance. Progress has been made in reading disjoint block letters [Weissman et. ai, 93].

Implementing Intelligence on Silicon,"We will present the implementation of intelligent electronic circuits realized for the first time using a new functional device called Neuron MOS Transistor (neuMOS or vMOS in short) simulating the behavior of biological neurons at a single transistor level. Search for the most resembling data in the memory cell array, for instance, can be automatically carried out on hardware without any software manipulation. Soft Hardware, which we named, can arbitrarily change its logic function in real time by external control signals without any hardware modification. Implementation of a neural network equipped with an on-chip self-learning capability is also described. Through the studies of vMOS intelligent circuit implementation, we noticed an interesting similarity in the architectures of vMOS logic circuitry and biological systems. 1 INTRODUCTION The motivation of this work has stemmed from the invention of a new functional transistor which simulates the behavior of biological neurons (Shiba",Optimization & Theoretical ML,82f2b308c3b01637c607ce05f52a2fed-Paper.pdf,1993
Probabilistic Anomaly Detection In,"This paper describes probabilistic methods for novelty detection when using pattern recognition methods for fault monitoring of dynamic systems. The problem of novelty detection is particular ly acute when prior knowledge and training data only allow one to construct an incomplete classification model. Allowance must be made in model design so that the classifier will be robust to data generated by classes not included in the training phase. For diagnosis applications one practical approach is to construct both an input density model and a discriminative class model. Using Bayes' rule and prior estimates of the relative likelihood of data of known and unknown origin the resulting classification equations are straightforward. The paper describes the application of this method in the context of hidden Markov models for online fault monitoring of large ground antennas for spacecraft tracking, with particular application to the detection of transient behaviour of unknown origin. 1 PROBLEM ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,846c260d715e5b854ffad5f70a516c88-Paper.pdf,1993
Learning Complex Boolean Functions:,"The most commonly used neural network models are not well suited to direct digital implementations because each node needs to per form a large number of operations between floating point values. Fortunately, the ability to learn from examples and to generalize is not restricted to networks ofthis type. Indeed, networks where each node implements a simple Boolean function (Boolean networks) can be designed in such a way as to exhibit similar properties. Two algorithms that generate Boolean networks from examples are pre sented. The results show that these algorithms generalize very well in a class of problems that accept compact Boolean network descriptions. The techniques described are general and can be ap plied to tasks that are not known to have that characteristic. Two examples of applications are presented: image reconstruction and hand-written character recognition. 1 Introduction The main objective of this research is the design of algorithms for empirical learning that generate",Computer Vision,847cc55b7032108eee6dd897f3bca8a5-Paper.pdf,1993
A Unified Gradient-Descent/Clustering,"Although recurrent neural nets have been moderately successful in learning to emulate finite-state machines (FSMs), the continu ous internal state dynamics of a neural net are not well matched to the discrete behavior of an FSM. We describe an architecture, called DOLCE, that allows discrete states to evolve in a net as learn ing progresses. DOLCE consists of a standard recurrent neural net trained by gradient descent and an adaptive clustering technique that quantizes the state space. DOLCE is based on the assumption that a finite set of discrete internal states is required for the task, and that the actual network state belongs to this set but has been corrupted by noise due to inaccuracy in the weights. DOLCE learns to recover the discrete state with maximum a posteriori probabil ity from the noisy state. Simulations show that DOLCE leads to a significant improvement in generalization performance over earlier neural net approaches to FSM induction. 1 INTRODUCTION Researchers often t",Optimization & Theoretical ML,84f7e69969dea92a925508f7c1f9579a-Paper.pdf,1993
Convergence of Indirect Adaptive,"Reinforcement Learning methods based on approximating dynamic programming (DP) are receiving increased attention due to their utility in forming reactive control policies for systems embedded in dynamic environments. Environments are usually modeled as controlled Markov processes, but when the environment model is not known a priori, adaptive methods are necessary. Adaptive con trol methods are often classified as being direct or indirect. Direct methods directly adapt the control policy from experience, whereas indirect methods adapt a model of the controlled process and com pute control policies based on the latest model. Our focus is on indirect adaptive DP-based methods in this paper. We present a convergence result for indirect adaptive asynchronous value itera tion algorithms for the case in which a look-up table is used to store the value function.

Fast Pruning Using Principal,"We present a new algorithm for eliminating excess parameters and improving network generalization after supervised training. The method, ""Principal Components Pruning (PCP)"", is based on prin cipal component analysis of the node activations of successive layers of the network. It is simple, cheap to implement, and effective. It requires no network retraining, and does not involve calculating the full Hessian of the cost function. Only the weight and the node activity correlation matrices for each layer of nodes are required. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on a regression problem using polynomial basis functions, and on an economic time series prediction problem using a two-layer, feedforward network. 1 Introduction In supervised learning, a network is presented with a set of training exemplars = [u(k), y(k)), k 1 ...

Postal Address Block Location Using A,"This paper describes the use of a convolutional neural network to perform address block location on machine-printed mail pieces. Locating the address block is a difficult object recognition problem because there is often a large amount of extraneous printing on a mail piece and because address blocks vary dramatically in size and shape. We used a convolutional locator network with four outputs, each trained to find a different corner of the address block. A simple set of rules was used to generate ABL candidates from the network output. The system performs very well: when allowed five guesses, the network will tightly bound the address delivery information in 98.2% of the cases. 1 INTRODUCTION The U.S. Postal Service delivers about 350 million mail pieces a day. On this scale, even highly sophisticated and custom-built sorting equipment quickly pays for itself.

Its hardware is based on our previously proposed forward-inverse-relaxation neural network (Wada & Kawato, 1993). Computationally, its optimization principle is the minimum torque change criterion. Regarding the representation level, hard constraints satisfied by a trajectory are represented as a set of via-points extracted from a handwritten character. Accordingly, we propose a via-point estimation algorithm that estimates via-points by repeating the trajectory formation of a character and the via-point extraction from the character. In experiments, good quantitative agreement is found between human handwriting data and the trajectories generated by the theory.

Discontinuous Generalization in Large,"The problem of learning from examples in multilayer networks is studied within the framework of statistical mechanics. Using the replica formalism we calculate the average generalization error of a fully connected committee machine in the limit of a large number of hidden units. If the number of training examples is proportional to the number of inputs in the network, the generalization error as a function of the training set size approaches a finite value. If the number of training examples is proportional to the number of weights in the network we find first-order phase transitions with a discontinuous drop in the generalization error for both binary and continuous weights. 1 INTRODUCTION Feedforward neural networks are widely used as nonlinear, parametric models for the solution of classification tasks and function approximation.

Figure of Merit Training for Detection and,"Spotting tasks require detection of target patterns from a background of richly varied non-target inputs. The performance measure of interest for these tasks, called the figure of merit (FOM), is the detection rate for target patterns when the false alarm rate is in an acceptable range. A new approach to training spotters is presented which computes the FOM gradient for each input pattern and then directly maximizes the FOM using b ackpropagati on. This eliminates the need for thresholds during training. It also uses network resources to model Bayesian a posteriori probability functions accurately only for patterns which have a significant effect on the detection accuracy over the false alarm rate of interest.

It then uses a set of generative weights to convert the code vector into an approximate reconstruction of the input vector. We derive an objective function for training autoencoders based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The aim is to minimize the information required to describe both the code vector and the reconstruction error. We show that this information is minimized by choosing code vectors stochastically according to a Boltzmann distri bution, where the generative weights define the energy of each possible code vector given the input vector. Unfortunately, if the code vectors use distributed representations, it is exponentially expensive to compute this Boltzmann distribution because it involves all possible code vectors.

Dual Mechanisms for Neural Binding,"We propose that the binding and segmentation of visual features is mediated by two complementary mechanisms; a low resolu tion, spatial-based, resource-free process and a high resolution, temporal-based, resource-limited process.

We find that the required retraining steps in OBD may lead to inferior generaliza tion, a result that can be interpreted as due to injecting noise back into the system. A common technique is to stop training of a large network at the minimum validation error. We found that the test error could be reduced even further by means of OBS (but not OBD) pruning.

The system combines the advantages of both analog and digital circuits. featuring low power consumption while minimizing overall system error. The analog circuits have been fabricated and tested, the system has been built, and several applications have been executed on the system. One application provides significantly better results for a remote sensing problem than have been previously obtained using conventional methods. 1.0 Introduction This paper describes a neurocomputer development system that uses a radial basis function as the transfer function of a neuron rather than the traditional sigmoid function.

Resolving motion ambiguities,"We address the problem of optical flow reconstruction and in par ticular the problem of resolving ambiguities near edges. They oc cur due to (i) the aperture problem and (ii) the occlusion problem, where pixels on both sides of an intensity edge are assigned the same velocity estimates (and confidence). However, these measurements are correct for just one side of the edge (the non occluded one). Our approach is to introduce an uncertamty field with respect to the estimates and confidence measures. We note that the confi dence measures are large at intensity edges and larger at the con vex sides of the edges, i.e. inside corners, than at the concave side. We resolve the ambiguities through local interactions via coupled Markov random fields (MRF). The result is the detection of motion for regions of images with large global convexity. 1 Introduction In this paper we discuss the problem of figure ground separation, via optical flow, for homogeneous images (textured images just provide mo",Computer Vision,b7ee6f5f9aa5cd17ca1aea43ce848496-Paper.pdf,1993
Developing Population Codes By,"The Minimum Description Length principle (MDL) can be used to train the hidden units of a neural network to extract a representa tion that is cheap to describe but nonetheless allows the input to be reconstructed accurately. We show how MDL can be used to develop highly redundant population codes. Each hidden unit has a location in a low-dimensional implicit space. If the hidden unit activities form a bump of a standard shape in this space, they can be cheaply encoded by the center ofthis bump. So the weights from the input units to the hidden units in an autoencoder are trained to make the activities form a standard bump. The coordinates of the hidden units in the implicit space are also learned, thus allow ing flexibility, as the network develops a discontinuous topography when presented with different input classes. Population-coding in a space other than the input enables a network to extract nonlinear higher-order properties of the inputs.

Accurate prediction of the conventional secondary structure classes: alpha helix, beta strand, and coil, from primary sequence has long been an important problem in compu tational molecular biology. Neural networks have been a popular method to attempt to predict these conventional secondary struc ture classes. Accuracy has been disappointingly low. The algo rithm presented here uses neural networks to similtaneously exam ine both sequence and structure data, and to evolve new classes of secondary structure that can be predicted from sequence with significantly higher accuracy than the conventional classes.

Coupled Dynamics of Fast Neurons and,"A simple model of coupled dynamics of fast neurons and slow inter actions, modelling self-organization in recurrent neural networks, leads naturally to an effective statistical mechanics characterized by a partition function which is an average over a replicated system. This is reminiscent of the replica trick used to study spin-glasses, but with the difference that the number of replicas has a physi cal meaning as the ratio of two temperatures and can be varied throughout the whole range of real values. The model has inter esting phase consequences as a function of varying this ratio and external stimuli, and can be extended to a range of other models. 1 A SIMPLE MODEL WITH FAST DYNAMIC NEURONS AND SLOW DYNAMIC INTERACTIONS As the basic archetypal model we consider a system of Ising spin neurons (J'i E {-I, I}, i E {I, ... , N}, interacting via continuous-valued symmetric interactions, Iij, which themselves evolve in response to the states of the neurons.

However, general dynamic programming is computationally intractable. We have developed procedures that allow more complex planning and control problems to be solved. We use second order local trajectory optimization to generate locally optimal plans and local models of the value function and its derivatives. We maintain global consistency of the local models of the value function, guaranteeing that our locally optimal plans are actually globally optimal, up to the resolution of our search procedures. Learning to do the right thing at each instant in situations that evolve over time is difficult, as the future cost of actions chosen now may not be obvious immediately, and may only become clear with time. Value functions are a representational tool that makes the consequences of actions explicit.

Structural and Behavioral Evolution,"This paper introduces GNARL, an evolutionary program which induces recurrent neural networks that are structurally unconstrained. In contrast to constructive and destructive algorithms, GNARL employs a popula tion of networks and uses a fitness function's unsupervised feedback to guide search through network space. Annealing is used in generating both gaussian weight changes and structural modifications. Applying GNARL to a complex search and collection task demonstrates that the system is capable of inducing networks with complex internal dynamics. 1 INTRODUCTION A variety of methods to induce network architecture exist. Some start with a very simple network and incrementally add nodes and links (Hanson 1990; Fahlman & Lebiere, 1990; Fahlman 1991; Chen, et aI., 1993); others start with a large network and then prune off superfluous pieces (Mozer & Smolensky, 1989; Cun, Denker, and SolI a, 1990; Hassibi & Stork, 1993; amlin & Giles, 1993).

The resulting algorithm is a form of coarse-to-fine correlation matching. We first consider problems of matching synthetic point data, and derive a point matching objective function. A tractable line segment matching objective function is derived by considering each line segment as a dense collection of points, and approximat ing it by a sum of Gaussians. The algorithm is tested on real images from which line segments are extracted and matched. 1 Introduction Assume that an object in a scene can be viewed as an instance of the model placed in space by some spatial transformation, and object recognition is achieved by dis covering an instance of the model in the scene.

Rather Than Weights,"The conventional Bayesian justification of backprop is that it finds the MAP weight vector. As this paper shows, to find the MAP i-o function instead one must add a correction tenn to backprop. That tenn biases one towards i-o functions with small description lengths, and in particular fa vors (some kinds of) feature-selection, pruning, and weight-sharing. 1 INTRODUCTION In the conventional Bayesian view ofbackpropagation (BP) (Buntine and Weigend, 1991; Nowlan and Hinton,1994; MacKay,I992; Wolpert, 1993), one starts with the ""likelihood"" conditional distribution P(training set = t I weight vector w) and the ""prior"" distribution P(w).

Fast Non-Linear Dimension Reduction,"We present a fast algorithm for non-linear dimension reduction. The algorithm builds a local linear model of the data by merging PCA with clustering based on a new distortion measure. Exper iments with speech and image data indicate that the local linear algorithm produces encodings with lower distortion than those built by five layer auto-associative networks. The local linear algorithm is also more than an order of magnitude faster to train. 1 Introduction Feature sets can be more compact than the data they represent. Dimension reduc tion provides compact representations for storage, transmission, and classification. Dimension reduction algorithms operate by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancies in the data. The optimal linear technique for dimension reduction is principal component anal ysis (PCA).

Locally finite discrete (boolean) neural networks are observable without exception. 1 INTRODUCTION We address some aspects of the general problem of implementation and robustness of (mainly recurrent) autonomous discrete-time neural networks with continuous activation (herein referred to as analog networks) and discrete activation (herein, boolean networks). There are three main sources of perturbations from ideal oper ation in a neural network. First, the network's parameters may have been contam inated with noise from external sources.

Optimal signalling in Attractor Neural,"In [Meilijson and Ruppin, 1993] we presented a methodological framework describing the two-iteration performance of Hopfield like attractor neural networks with history-dependent, Bayesian dynamics. We now extend this analysis in a number of directions: input patterns applied to small subsets of neurons, general con nectivity architectures and more efficient use of history. We show that the optimal signal (activation) function has a slanted sigmQidal shape, and provide an intuitive account of activation functions with a non-monotone shape. This function endows the model with some properties characteristic of cortical neurons' firing. 1 Introduction It is well known that a given cortical neuron can respond with a different firing pat tern for the same synaptic input, depending on its firing history and on the effects of modulator transmitters (see [Connors and Gutnick, 1990] for a review).

If actions are expensive and computation is cheap, then we should explore by selecting a trajectory through the in put space which gives us the most amount of information in the fewest number of steps. I discuss how results from the field of opti mal experiment design may be used to guide such exploration, and demonstrate its use on a simple kinematics problem. 1 Introduction Most machine learning research treats the learner as a passive receptacle for data to be processed. This approach ignores the fact that, in many situations, a learner is able, and sometimes required, to act on its environment to gather data. Learning control inherently involves being active; the controller must act in order to learn the result of its action.

Asynchronous Dynamics of Continuous,"Motivated by mathematical modeling, analog implementation and distributed simulation of neural networks, we present a definition of asynchronous dynamics of general CT dynamical systems defined by ordinary differential equations, based on notions of local times and communication times. We provide some preliminary results on globally asymptotical convergence of asynchronous dynamics for contractive and monotone CT dynamical systems. When ap plying the results to neural networks, we obtain some conditions that ensure additive-type neural networks to be asynchronizable. 1 INTRODUCTION Neural networks are massively distributed computing systems. A major issue in par allel and distributed computation is synchronization versus asynchronization (Bert sekas and Tsitsiklis, 1989). To fix our idea, we consider a much studied additive-type model (Cohen and Grossberg, 1983; Hopfield, 1984; Hirsch, 1989) of a continuous time (CT) neural network of n neurons, whose dynamics is governed by Ln = + + =",Optimization & Theoretical ML,dc5689792e08eb2e219dce49e64c885b-Paper.pdf,1993
Development of Orientation and Ocular,"Maps of orientation preference and ocular dominance were recorded optically from the cortices of 5 infant macaque monkeys, ranging in age from 3.5 to 14 weeks. In agreement with previous observations, we found that basic features of orientation and ocular dominance maps, as well as correlations between them, are present and robust by 3.5 weeks of age. We did observe changes in the strength of ocular dominance signals, as well as in the spacing of ocular dom inance bands, both of which increased steadily between 3.5 and 14 weeks of age. The latter finding suggests that the adult spacing of ocular dominance bands depends on cortical growth in neonatal animals. Since we found no corresponding increase in the spacing of orientation preferences, however, there is a possibility that the orientation preferences of some cells change as the cortical surface expands. Since correlations between the patterns of orientation selectivity and ocular dominance are present at an age, when the visual sys",Computer Vision,dd45045f8c68db9f54e70c67048d32e8-Paper.pdf,1993

Comparing these results with recent estimates of VC-dimension we find that in contrast to the single neuron case, for sufficiently large nand hl, the VC-dimension exceeds Cover's capacity. 1 Introduction In the course of theoretical justification of many of the claims made about neural networks regarding their ability to learn a set of patterns and their ability to gen eralis",Optimization & Theoretical ML,df263d996281d984952c07998dc54358-Paper.pdf,1993
Supervised Learning with Growing Cell,"We present a new incremental radial basis function network suit able for classification and regression problems. Center positions are continuously updated through soft competitive learning. The width of the radial basis functions is derived from the distance to topological neighbors. During the training the observed error is accumulated locally and used to determine where to insert the next unit. This leads (in case of classification problems) to the placement of units near class borders rather than near frequency peaks as is done by most existing methods. The resulting networks need few training epochs and seem to generalize very well. This is demonstrated by examples. 1 INTRODUCTION Feed-forward networks of localized (e.g., Gaussian) units are an interesting alter native to the more frequently used networks of global (e.g., sigmoidal) units.

For classifiers, the algorithm can directly reduce the number of misclassifications on the training set. Unfortu nately, when modeling human learning or constructing classifiers for au tonomous robots, supervisory labels are often not available or too ex pensive. In this paper we show that we can substitute for the labels by making use of structure between the pattern distributions to different sen sory modalities. We show that minimizing the disagreement between the outputs of networks processing patterns from these different modalities is a sensible approximation to minimizing the number of misclassifications in each modality, and leads to similar results. Using the Peterson-Barney vowel dataset we show that the algorithm performs well in finding ap propriate placement for the codebook vectors particularly when the con fuseable classes are different for the two modalities. 1 INT",Deep Learning,e0ec453e28e061cc58ac43f91dc2f3f0-Paper.pdf,1993

We show that when the network is in a stationary state, the cross-correlations are relatively weak, i.e., their amplitude relative to that of the auto-correlations are of or der of 1/N , N being the size of the interacting population. This holds except in the neighborhoods of bifurcations to nonstationary states. As a bifurcation point is approached the amplitude of the cross-correlations grows and becomes of order 1 and the decay time constant diverges. This behavior is analogous to the phenomenon of critic",Optimization & Theoretical ML,f7e9050c92a851b0016442ab604b0488-Paper.pdf,1993
Clustering with a Domain-Specific,"With a point matching distance measure which is invariant under translation, rotation and permutation, we learn 2-D point-set ob jects, by clustering noisy point-set images. Unlike traditional clus tering methods which use distance measures that operate on feature vectors - a representation common to most problem domains - this object-based clustering technique employs a distance measure spe cific to a type of object within a problem domain. Formulating the clustering problem as two nested objective functions, we derive optimization dynamics similar to the Expectation-Maximization algorithm used in mixture models. 1 Introduction Clustering and related unsupervised learning techniques such as competitive learn ing and self-organizing maps have traditionally relied on measures of distance, like Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance, which are generic across most problem domains.

SPEAKER RECOGNITION USING,"A new classifier is presented for text-independent speaker recognition. The new classifier is called the modified neural tree network (MNTN). The NTN is a hierarchical classifier that combines the properties of decision trees and feed-forward neural networks. The MNTN differs from the stan dard NTN in that a new learning rule based on discriminant learning is used, which minimizes the classification error as opposed to a norm of the approximation error. The MNTN also uses leaf probability mea sures in addition to the class labels. The MNTN is evaluated for several speaker identification experiments and is compared to multilayer percep trons (MLPs), decision trees, and vector quantization (VQ) classifiers. The VQ classifier and MNTN demonstrate comparable performance and per form significantly better than the other classifiers for this task.

Tonal Music as a Componential Code:,"This study explores the extent to which a network that learns the temporal relationships within and between the component features of Western tonal music can account for music theoretic and psychological phenomena such as the tonal hierarchy and rhythmic expectancies. Predicted and generated sequences were recorded as the representation of a 153-note waltz melody was learnt by a predictive, recurrent network. The network learned transitions and relations between and within pitch and timing components: accent and duration values interacted in the development of rhythmic and metric structures and, with training, the network developed chordal expectancies in response to the activation of individual tones. Analysis of the hidden unit representation revealed that musical sequences are represented as transitions between states in hidden unit space. 1 INTRODUCTION The fundamental features of music, derivable from frequency, time and amplitude dimensions of the physical signal, can be describe",NLP,fa14d4fe2f19414de3ebd9f63d5c0169-Paper.pdf,1993
Connectionist Models for,"Although the visual and auditory systems share the same basic tasks of informing an organism about its environment, most con nectionist work on hearing to date has been devoted to the very different problem of speech recognition.

Learning in Compositional Hierarchies:,"I propose a learning algorithm for learning hierarchical models for ob ject recognition. The model architecture is a compositional hierarchy that represents part-whole relationships: parts are described in the lo cal context of substructures of the object. The focus of this report is learning hierarchical models from data, i.e. inducing the structure of model prototypes from observed exemplars of an object. At each node in the hierarchy, a probability distribution governing its parameters must be learned. The connections between nodes reflects the structure of the object. The formulation of substructures is encouraged such that their parts become conditionally independent.

A VLSI circuit has been de signed to provide rapid phase-locking synchronization of multiple oscillators to allow for further exploration of this neural mechanism.

The model accounts for a number of psychophysical observations including experiments based on novel random textures. These textures are generated from white noise and manipulated in Fourier domain in order to produce specific frequency spectra. Simulations with a range of stimuli, including real images, show qualitative and quantitative agreement with human perception. 1 INTRODUCTION There are several physical cues to shape and depth which arise from changes in projection as a surface curves away from view, or recedes in perspective.

Encoding Labeled Graphs by Labeling,"In this paper we propose an extension to the RAAM by Pollack. This extension, the Labeling RAAM (LRAAM), can encode la beled graphs with cycles by representing pointers explicitly. Data encoded in an LRAAM can be accessed by pointer as well as by content. Direct access by content can be achieved by transform ing the encoder network of the LRAAM into an analog Hopfield network with hidden units. Different access procedures can be defined depending on the access key. Sufficient conditions on the asymptotical stability of the associated Hopfield network are briefly introduced. 1 INTRODUCTION In the last few years, several researchers have tried to demonstrate how symbolic structures such as lists, trees, and stacks can be represented and manipulated in a connectionist system, while still preserving all the computational characteristics of connectionism (and extending them to the symbolic representations) (Hinton, 1990; Plate, 1991; Pollack, 1990; Smolensky, 1990; Touretzky, 1990).

The model is built out of simple ingredients, depending on nothing more complicated than connectional specificity, attractor dynamics, Hebbian learning, and sigmoidal nonlinearities, but it behaves in a sophisticated way and is consistent with most of the observed properties ofreal head direction cells. In addition it makes a number of predictions that ought to be testable by reasonably straightforward experiments. 1 Head Direction Cells in the Rat There is quite a bit of behavioral evidence for an intrinsic sense of direction in many species of mammals, including rats and humans (e.g., Gallistel, 1990).

We demon strate our method first on computer-generated data with locally varying, normally distributed target noise. We then apply it to laser data from the Santa Fe Time Series Competition where the underlying system noise is known quantization error and the error bars give local estimates of model misspecification. In both cases, the method also provides a weighted regression effect that improves generalization performance. 1 Learning Local Error Bars Using a Maximum Likelihood Framework: Motivation, Concept, and Mechanics Feed-forward artificial neural networks used for nonlinear regression can be interpreted as predicting the mean of the target distribution as a function of (conditioned on) the input pattern (e.g., Bun",Optimization & Theoretical ML,061412e4a03c02f9902576ec55ebbe77-Paper.pdf,1994

Computing the exact bias and variance curves as a function of the sample size we are able to quantitatively compare the effect of the combination on the bias and variance separately, and thus on the expected error which is the sum of the two. Our exact calculations, demonstrate that the combination of estimators is particularly useful in the case where the data set is small and noisy and the function to be learned is unrealizable.

The resulting system can be thought of as a continuous-density HMM system, but instead of using gaussian mixtures, the HME system employs a large set of hierarchically organized but relatively small neural networks to perform the probability density estimation. The hierarchical structure is reminiscent of a decision tree except for two important differences: each ""expert"" or neural net performs a ""soft"" decision rather than a hard decision, and, unlike ordinary decision trees, the parameters of all the neural nets in the HME are automatically trainable using the EM algorithm.

Abu-Mustafa's hints work [1] shows that the outputs of a backprop net can be used as inputs through which domain specific information can be given to the net. We extend these ideas by showing that a backprop net learning many related tasks at the same time can use these tasks as inductive bias for each other and thus learn better. We identify five mechanisms by which multitask backprop improves generalization and give empirical evidence that multi task backprop generalizes better in real domains. 1 INTRODUCTION You and I rarely learn things one at a time, yet we often ask our programs to-it must be easier to learn things one at a time than to learn many things at once.

We show here how these basis functions can be used to generate receptive fields in either retinotopic or head-centered coordinates by simple linear transformations. This raises the possibility that the parietal cortex does not attempt to compute the positions of objects in a partic ular frame of reference but instead computes a general purpose representation of the retinal location and eye position from which any transformation can be synthesized by direct projection.

Interference in Learning Internal,"Experiments were performed to reveal some of the computational properties of the human motor memory system. We show that as humans practice reaching movements while interacting with a novel mechanical environment, they learn an internal model of the inverse dynamics of that environment. Subjects show recall of this model at testing sessions 24 hours after the initial practice. The representation of the internal model in memory is such that there is interference when there is an attempt to learn a new inverse dynamics map immediately after an anticorrelated mapping was learned. We suggest that this interference is an indication that the same computational elements used to encode the first inverse dynamics map are being used to learn the second mapping. We predict that this leads to a forgetting of the initially learned skill. 1 Introduction In tasks where we use our hands to interact with a tool, our motor system develops a model of the dynamics of that tool and uses this model to contr",Optimization & Theoretical ML,1e48c4420b7073bc11916c6c1de226bb-Paper.pdf,1994

Factorial Learning and the EM Algorithm,"Many real world learning problems are best characterized by an interaction of multiple independent causes or factors. Discover ing such causal structure from the data is the focus of this paper. Based on Zemel and Hinton's cooperative vector quantizer (CVQ) architecture, an unsupervised learning algorithm is derived from the Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. Due to the com binatorial nature of the data generation process, the exact E-step is computationally intractable. Two alternative methods for com puting the E-step are proposed: Gibbs sampling and mean-field approximation, and some promising empirical results are presented. 1 Introduction Many unsupervised learning problems fall under the rubric of factorial learning- that is, the goal of the learning algorithm is to discover multiple independent causes, or factors, that can well characterize the observed data (Barlow, 1989; Redlich, 1993; Hinton and Zemel, 1994; Saund, 1995).

Pairwise Neural Network Classifiers with,"Multi-class classification problems can be efficiently solved by partitioning the original problem into sub-problems involving only two classes: for each pair of classes, a (potentially small) neural network is trained using only the data of these two classes. We show how to combine the outputs of the two-class neural networks in order to obtain posterior probabilities for the class decisions. The resulting probabilistic pairwise classifier is part of a handwriting recognition system which is currently applied to check reading. We present results on real world data bases and show that, from a practical point of view, these results compare favorably to other neural network approaches. 1 Introduction Generally, a pattern classifier consists of two main parts: a feature extractor and a classification algorithm. Both parts have the same ultimate goal, namely to transform a given input pattern into a representation that is easily interpretable as a class decision.

Real-Time Control of a Tokamak Plasma,"This paper presents results from the first use of neural networks for the real-time feedback control of high temperature plasmas in a tokamak fusion experiment. The tokamak is currently the prin cipal experimental device for research into the magnetic confine ment approach to controlled fusion. In the tokamak, hydrogen plasmas, at temperatures of up to 100 Million K, are confined by strong magnetic fields. Accurate control of the position and shape of the plasma boundary requires real-time feedback control of the magnetic field structure on a time-scale of a few tens of mi croseconds. Software simulations have demonstrated that a neural network approach can give significantly better performance than the linear technique currently used on most tokamak experiments. The practical application of the neural network approach requires high-speed hardware, for which a fully parallel implementation of the multilayer perceptron, using a hybrid of digital and analogue technology, has been develop",Optimization & Theoretical ML,2387337ba1e0b0249ba90f55b2ba2521-Paper.pdf,1994
An Actor/Critic Algorithm that â¢,"We prove the convergence of an actor/critic algorithm that is equiv alent to Q-Iearning by construction. Its equivalence is achieved by encoding Q-values within the policy and value function of the ac tor and critic. The resultant actor/critic algorithm is novel in two ways: it updates the critic only when the most probable action is executed from any given state, and it rewards the actor using cri teria that depend on the relative probability of the action that was executed. 1 INTRODUCTION In actor/critic learning systems, the actor implements a stochastic policy that maps states to action probability vectors, and the critic attempts to estimate the value of each state in order to provide more useful reinforcement feedback to the actor. The result is two interacting adaptive processes: the actor adapts to the critic, while the critic adapts to the actor. The foundations of actor/critic learning systems date back at least to Samuel's checker program in the late 1950s (Samuel,1963).

Template-Based Algorithms for,"Casting neural network weights in symbolic terms is crucial for interpreting and explaining the behavior of a network. Additionally, in some domains, a symbolic description may lead to more robust generalization. We present a principled approach to symbolic rule extraction based on the notion of weight templates, parameterized regions of weight space corresponding to specific symbolic expressions. With an appropriate choice of representation, we show how template parameters may be efficiently identified and instantiated to yield the optimal match to a unit's actual weights. Depending on the requirements of the application domain, our method can accommodate arbitrary disjunctions and conjunctions with O(k) complexity, simple n-of-m expressions with O( k!) complexity, or a more general class of recursive n-of-m expressions with O(k!) complexity, where k is the number of inputs to a unit. Our method of rule extraction offers several benefits over alternative approaches in the literature, ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,24896ee4c6526356cc127852413ea3b4-Paper.pdf,1994
Reinforcement Learning with Soft State,"It is widely accepted that the use of more compact representations than lookup tables is crucial to scaling reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to real-world problems. Unfortunately almost all of the theory of reinforcement learning assumes lookup table representa tions. In this paper we address the pressing issue of combining function approximation and RL, and present 1) a function approx imator based on a simple extension to state aggregation (a com monly used form of compact representation), namely soft state aggregation, 2) a theory of convergence for RL with arbitrary, but fixed, soft state aggregation, 3) a novel intuitive understanding of the effect of state aggregation on online RL, and 4) a new heuristic adaptive state aggregation algorithm that finds improved compact representations by exploiting the non-discrete nature of soft state aggregation.

A Connectionist Technique for Accelerated,"Each year people spend a huge amount of time typing. The text people type typically contains a tremendous amount of redundancy due to predictable word usage patterns and the text's structure. This paper describes a neural network system call AutoTypist that monitors a person's typing and predicts what will be entered next. AutoTypist displays the most likely subsequent word to the typist, who can accept it with a single keystroke, instead of typing it in its entirety. The multi-layer perceptron at the heart of Auto'JYpist adapts its predictions of likely subsequent text to the user's word usage pattern, and to the characteristics of the text currently being typed. Increases in typing speed of 2-3% when typing English prose and 10-20% when typing C code have been demonstrated using the system, suggesting a potential time savings of more than 20 hours per user per year.

Advantage Updating Applied to,"An application of reinforcement learning to a linear-quadratic, differential game is presented. The reinforcement learning system uses a recently developed algorithm, the residual gradient form of advantage updating. The game is a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with continuous time, states, and actions, linear dynamics, and a quadratic cost function. The game consists of two players, a missile and a plane; the missile pursues the plane and the plane evades the missile. The reinforcement learning algorithm for optimal control is modified for differential games in order to find the minimax point, rather than the maximum. Simulation results are compared to the optimal solution, demonstrating that the simulated reinforcement learning system converges to the optimal answer. The performance of both the residual gradient and non-residual gradient forms of advantage updating and Q-learning are compared. The results show that advantage updating converges faster than Q-learning in all simulations",Reinforcement Learning,2a9d121cd9c3a1832bb6d2cc6bd7a8a7-Paper.pdf,1994
Malcolm Slaney,"Deciding the appropriate representation to use for modeling human auditory processing is a critical issue in auditory science. While engi neers have successfully performed many single-speaker tasks with LPC and spectrogram methods, more difficult problems will need a richer representation. This paper describes a powerful auditory representation known as the correlogram and shows how this non-linear representation can be converted back into sound, with no loss of perceptually impor tant information. The correlogram is interesting because it is a neuro physiologically plausible representation of sound. This paper shows improved methods for spectrogram inversion (conventional pattern playback), inversion of a cochlear model, and inversion of the correlo gram representation. 1 INTRODUCTIONl My interest in auditory models and perceptual displays [2] is motivated by the problem of sound understanding, especially the separation of speech from noisy backgrounds and interfering speakers.

We sketch out a decompression algorithm for fractal block codes and then show how to implement a recurrent neural network using physically simple but highly-nonlinear, analog circuit models of neurons and synapses. The nonlinear system has many fixed points, but we have at our disposal a procedure to choose the parameters in such a way that only one solution, the desired solution, is stable. As a partial proof of the concept, we present experimental data from a small system a 16-neuron analog CMOS chip fabricated in a 2m analog p-well process.

Phase-Space Learning,"Existing recurrent net learning algorithms are inadequate. We in troduce the conceptual framework of viewing recurrent training as matching vector fields of dynamical systems in phase space. Phase space reconstruction techniques make the hidden states explicit, reducing temporal learning to a feed-forward problem. In short, we propose viewing iterated prediction [LF88] as the best way of training recurrent networks on deterministic signals. Using this framework, we can train multiple trajectories, insure their stabil ity, and design arbitrary dynamical systems. 1 INTRODUCTION Existing general-purpose recurrent algorithms are capable of rich dynamical be havior. Unfortunately, straightforward applications of these algorithms to training fully-recurrent networks on complex temporal tasks have had much less success than their feedforward counterparts.

Inferring Ground Truth from Subjective,"In remote sensing applications ""ground-truth"" data is often used as the basis for training pattern recognition algorithms to gener ate thematic maps or to detect objects of interest. In practical situations, experts may visually examine the images and provide a subjective noisy estimate of the truth. Calibrating the reliability and bias of expert labellers is a non-trivial problem. In this paper we discuss some of our recent work on this topic in the context of detecting small volcanoes in Magellan SAR images of Venus. Empirical results (using the Expectation-Maximization procedure) suggest that accounting for subjective noise can be quite signifi cant in terms of quantifying both human and algorithm detection performance. 1 Introduction In certain pattern recognition applications, particularly in remote-sensing and med ical diagnosis, the standard assumption that the labelling of the data has been * and Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology 1086 Padhraic Smyth.

Learning Prototype Models for Tangent,"Simard, LeCun & Denker (1993) showed that the performance of nearest-neighbor classification schemes for handwritten character recognition can be improved by incorporating invariance to spe cific transformations in the underlying distance metric - the so called tangent distance. The resulting classifier, however, can be prohibitively slow and memory intensive due to the large amount of prototypes that need to be stored and used in the distance compar isons. In this paper we develop rich models for representing large subsets of the prototypes.

Diffusion of Credit in Markovian Models,"This paper studies the problem of diffusion in Markovian models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and how it makes very difficult the task of learning of long-term dependencies in sequences. Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that the problem of diffusion is reduced if the transition probabilities approach 0 or 1. Under this condition, standard HMMs have very limited modeling capabilities, but input/output HMMs can still perform interesting computations. 1 Introduction This paper presents an important new element in our research on the problem of learning long-term dependencies in sequences. In our previous work [4J we found theoretical reasons for the difficulty in training recurrent networks (or more gen erally parametric non-linear dynamical systems) to learn long-term dependencies.

Model of a Biological Neuron as a Temporal,"A biological neuron can be viewed as a device that maps a multidimen sional temporal event signal (dendritic postsynaptic activations) into a unidimensional temporal event signal (action potentials). We have designed a network, the Spatio-Temporal Event Mapping (STEM) architecture, which can learn to perform this mapping for arbitrary bio physical models of neurons. Such a network appropriately trained, called a STEM cell, can be used in place of a conventional compartmen tal model in simulations where only the transfer function is important, such as network simulations.

Non-linear Prediction of Acoustic Vectors,"In this paper we consider speech coding as a problem of speech modelling. In particular, prediction of parameterised speech over short time segments is performed using the Hierarchical Mixture of Experts (HME) (Jordan & Jacobs 1994). The HME gives two ad vantages over traditional non-linear function approximators such as the Multi-Layer Percept ron (MLP); a statistical understand ing of the operation of the predictor and provision of information about the performance of the predictor in the form of likelihood information and local error bars. These two issues are examined on both toy and real world problems of regression and time series prediction. In the speech coding context, we extend the principle of combining local predictions via the HME to a Vector Quantiza tion scheme in which fixed local codebooks are combined on-line for each observation. 1 INTRODUCTION We are concerned in this paper with the application of multiple models, specifi cally the Hierarchical Mixtures of Experts, ",Deep Learning,437d7d1d97917cd627a34a6a0fb41136-Paper.pdf,1994
JPMAX: Learning to Recognize Moving,"Unsupervised learning procedures have been successful at low-level feature extraction and preprocessing of raw sensor data. So far, however, they have had limited success in learning higher-order representations, e.g., of objects in visual images. A promising ap proach is to maximize some measure of agreement between the outputs of two groups of units which receive inputs physically sep arated in space, time or modality, as in (Becker and Hinton, 1992; Becker, 1993; de Sa, 1993). Using the same approach, a much sim pler learning procedure is proposed here which discovers features in a single-layer network consisting of several populations of units, and can be applied to multi-layer networks trained one layer at a time.

Reinforcement Learning Predicts the Site,"The auditory system of the barn owl contains several spatial maps. In young barn owls raised with optical prisms over their eyes, these auditory maps are shifted to stay in register with the visual map, suggesting that the visual input imposes a frame of reference on the auditory maps. However, the optic tectum, the first site of convergence of visual with auditory information, is not the site of plasticity for the shift of the auditory maps; the plasticity occurs instead in the inferior colliculus, which contains an auditory map and projects into the optic tectum.

Maximum likelihood estimation is done via Boltzmann learning in one-dimensional networks with tied weights. We call these networks Boltzmann chains and show that they contain hidden Markov models (HMMs) as a special case. Our framework also motivates new architectures that address partic ular shortcomings of HMMs. We look at two such architectures: parallel chains that model feature sets with disparate time scales, and looped networks that model long-term dependencies between hidden states. For these networks, we show how to implement the Boltzmann learning rule exactly, in polynomial time, without resort to simulated or mean-field annealing. The necessary com putations are done by exact decimation procedures from statistical mechanics. 1 INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY Statistical models of discrete time series have a wide range of applications, most notably to problems in speech recognition (Juang & Rabi",Optimization & Theoretical ML,4e0cb6fb5fb446d1c92ede2ed8780188-Paper.pdf,1994

We show analytically that with the selective gating mechanism the network rapidly achieves both synchronization within blocks of oscillators that are stimulated by connected regions and desynchronization between different blocks.

The lat ter solution is closely related to the mixture of experts approach and we show how learning rules for the mixture of experts can be derived from the theory about learning with missing features. The presented approaches are modular since the weighting functions can easily be modified (no retraining) if more estimators are ad ded.

However, studies of networks of three-state neurons have been rather limited (Meunier, Hansel and Verga, 1989). A master equation was intro duced by Cowan (1991) to study stochastic neural networks.

On the Computational Utility of,"We propose a computational framework for understanding and modeling human consciousness. This framework integrates many existing theoretical perspectives, yet is sufficiently concrete to allow simulation experiments. We do not attempt to explain qualia (sub jective experience), but instead ask what differences exist within the cognitive information processing system when a person is con scious of mentally-represented information versus when that infor mation is unconscious. The central idea we explore is that the con tents of consciousness correspond to temporally persistent states in a network of computational modules. Three simulations are de scribed illustrating that the behavior of persistent states in the models corresponds roughly to the behavior of conscious states people experience when performing similar tasks. Our simulations show that periodic settling to persistent (i.e., conscious) states im proves performance by cleaning up inaccuracies and noise, forcing decisions, and h",Optimization & Theoretical ML,6aab1270668d8cac7cef2566a1c5f569-Paper.pdf,1994
Ocular Dominance and Patterned Lateral,"A neural network model for the self-organization of ocular dominance and lateral connections from binocular input is presented. The self-organizing process results in a network where (1) afferent weights of each neuron or ganize into smooth hill-shaped receptive fields primarily on one of the reti nas, (2) neurons with common eye preference form connected, intertwined patches, and (3) lateral connections primarily link regions of the same eye preference. Similar self-organization of cortical structures has been ob served experimentally in strabismic kittens. The model shows how pat terned lateral connections in the cortex may develop based on correlated activity and explains why lateral connection patterns follow receptive field properties such as ocular dominance. 1 Introduction Lateral connections in the primary visual cortex have a patterned structure that closely matches the response properties of cortical cells (Gilbert and Wiesel 1989; Malach et al.1993).

Effects of Noise on Convergence and,"We introduce and study methods of inserting synaptic noise into dynamically-driven recurrent neural networks and show that ap plying a controlled amount of noise during training may improve convergence and generalization. In addition, we analyze the effects of each noise parameter (additive vs. multiplicative, cumulative vs. non-cumulative, per time step vs. per string) and predict that best overall performance can be achieved by injecting additive noise at each time step. Extensive simulations on learning the dual parity grammar from temporal strings substantiate these predictions. 1 INTRODUCTION There has been much research in applying noise to neural networks to improve net work performance. It has been shown that using noisy hidden nodes during training can result in error-correcting codes which increase the tolerance of feedforward nets to unreliable nodes (Judd and Munro, 1992). Also, randomly disabling hidden nodes during the training phase increases the tolerance of MLP's to no",Deep Learning,6c3cf77d52820cd0fe646d38bc2145ca-Paper.pdf,1994
An Integrated Architecture of Adaptive Neural Network,"In this study, an integrated neural network control architecture for nonlinear dynamic systems is presented. Most of the recent emphasis in the neural network control field has no error feedback as the control input, which rises the lack of adaptation problem. The integrated architecture in this paper combines feed forward control and error feedback adaptive control using neural networks. The paper reveals the different internal functionality of these two kinds of neural network controllers for certain input styles, e.g., state feedback and error feedback. With error feedback, neural network controllers learn the slopes or the gains with respect to the error feedback, producing an error driven adaptive control systems. The results demonstrate that the two kinds of control scheme can be combined to realize their individual advantages. Testing with disturbances added to the plant shows good tracking and adaptation with the integrated neural control architecture. 1 INTRODUCTION Neural net",Optimization & Theoretical ML,6cfe0e6127fa25df2a0ef2ae1067d915-Paper.pdf,1994

Estimating Conditional Probability,"Most of the common techniques for estimating conditional prob ability densities are inappropriate for applications involving peri odic variables. In this paper we introduce three novel techniques for tackling such problems, and investigate their performance us ing synthetic data. We then apply these techniques to the problem of extracting the distribution of wind vector directions from radar scatterometer data gathered by a remote-sensing satellite. 1 INTRODUCTION Many applications of neural networks can be formulated in terms of a multi-variate non-linear mapping from an input vector x to a target vector t. A conventional neural network approach, based on least squares for example, leads to a network mapping which approximates the regression of t on x. A more complete description of the data can be obtained by estimating the conditional probability density of t, conditioned on x, which we write as p(tlx). Various techniques exist for modelling such densities when the target variables ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,74bba22728b6185eec06286af6bec36d-Paper.pdf,1994
Analysis of Unstandardized Contributions,"Understanding knowledge representations in neural nets has been a difficult problem. Principal components analysis (PCA) of contributions (products of sending activations and connection weights) has yielded valuable insights into knowledge representations, but much of this work has focused on the correlation matrix of contributions. The present work shows that analyzing the variance-covariance matrix of contributions yields more valid insights by taking account of weights. 1 INTRODUCTION The knowledge representations learned by neural networks are usually difficult to understand because of the non-linear properties of these nets and the fact that knowledge is often distributed across many units. Standard network analysis techniques, based on a network's connection weights or on its hidden unit activations, have been limited.

A Rigorous Analysis Of,"We propose a novel rigorous approach for the analysis of Linsker's unsupervised Hebbian learning network. The behavior of this model is determined by the underlying nonlinear dynamics which are parameterized by a set of parameters originating from the Heb bian rule and the arbor density of the synapses. These parameters determine the presence or absence of a specific receptive field (also referred to as a 'connection pattern') as a saturated fixed point attractor of the model. In this paper, we perform a qualitative analysis of the underlying nonlinear dynamics over the parameter space, determine the effects of the system parameters on the emer gence of various receptive fields, and predict precisely within which parameter regime the network will have the potential to develop a specially designated connection pattern. In particular, this ap proach exposes, for the first time, the crucial role played by the synaptic density functions, and provides a complete precise picture of the param",Optimization & Theoretical ML,7634ea65a4e6d9041cfd3f7de18e334a-Paper.pdf,1994
Associative Decorrelation Dynamics:,"This paper outlines a dynamic theory of development and adap tation in neural networks with feedback connections. Given in put ensemble, the connections change in strength according to an associative learning rule and approach a stable state where the neuronal outputs are decorrelated. We apply this theory to pri mary visual cortex and examine the implications of the dynamical decorrelation of the activities of orientation selective cells by the intracortical connections. The theory gives a unified and quantita tive explanation of the psychophysical experiments on orientation contrast and orientation adaptation. Using only one parameter, we achieve good agreements between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data. 1 Introduction The mammalian visual system is very effective in detecting the orientations of lines and most neurons in primary visual cortex selectively respond to oriented lines and form orientation columns [1).

Finding Structure in Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement learning addresses the problem of learning to select actions in order to maximize one's performance in unknown environments. To scale reinforcement learning to complex real-world tasks, such as typically studied in AI, one must ultimately be able to discover the structure in the world, in order to abstract away the myriad of details and to operate in more tractable problem spaces. This paper presents the SKILLS algorithm. SKILLS discovers skills, which are partially defined action policies that arise in the context of multiple, related tasks. Skills collapse whole action sequences into single operators. They are learned by minimizing the com pactness of action policies, using a description length argument on their representation. Empirical results in simple grid navigation tasks illustrate the successful discovery of structure in reinforcement learning. 1 Introduction Reinforcement learning comprises a family of incremental planning algorithms that construct reactive cont",Reinforcement Learning,7ce3284b743aefde80ffd9aec500e085-Paper.pdf,1994
Active Learning with Statistical Models,"For many types of learners one can compute the statistically ""op timal"" way to select data. We review how these techniques have been used with feedforward neural networks [MacKay, 1992; Cohn, 1994]. We then show how the same principles may be used to select data for two alternative, statistically-based learning architectures: mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression. While the techniques for neural networks are expensive and approximate, the techniques for mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regres sion are both efficient and accurate. 1 ACTIVE LEARNING - BACKGROUND An active learning problem is one where the learner has the ability or need to influence or select its own training data. Many problems of great practical interest allow active learning, and many even require it. We consider the problem of actively learning a mapping X - Y based on a set of training examples {(Xi,Yi)}~l' where Xi E X and Yi E Y.

From Data Distributions to,"Ideally pattern recognition machines provide constant output when the inputs are transformed under a group 9 of desired invariances. These invariances can be achieved by enhancing the training data to include examples of inputs transformed by elements of g, while leaving the corresponding targets unchanged. Alternatively the cost function for training can include a regularization term that penalizes changes in the output when the input is transformed un der the group. This paper relates the two approaches, showing precisely the sense in which the regularized cost function approximates the result of adding transformed (or distorted) examples to the training data. The cost function for the enhanced training set is equivalent to the sum of the original cost function plus a regularizer. For unbiased models, the regularizer reduces to the intuitively obvious choice - a term that penalizes changes in the output when the inputs are transformed under the group.

Recurrent networks allow to model complex dynamical systems and can store and retrieve contextual information in a flexible way.

Grouping Components of,"Many cells in the dorsal part of the medial superior temporal (MST) area of visual cortex respond selectively to spiral flow patterns-specific combinations of expansion/ contraction and ro tation motions. Previous investigators have suggested that these cells may represent self-motion. Spiral patterns can also be gener ated by the relative motion of the observer and a particular object. An MST cell may then account for some portion of the complex flow field, and the set of active cells could encode the entire flow; in this manner, MST effectively segments moving objects. Such a grouping operation is essential in interpreting scenes containing several independent moving objects and observer motion. We de scribe a model based on the hypothesis that the selective tuning of MST cells reflects the grouping of object components undergo ing coherent motion.

The model developed performs nonlin ear decorrelation up to higher orders of the cumulant tensors and results in probabilistic ally independent components of the output layer. This means that we don't need to assume Gaussian distribution neither at the input nor at the output. The theory presented is related to the unsuper vised-learning theory of Barlow, which proposes redundancy reduction as the goal of cognition.

Generalisation in Feedforward Networks,"We discuss a model of consistent learning with an additional re striction on the probability distribution of training samples, the target concept and hypothesis class. We show that the model pro vides a significant improvement on the upper bounds of sample complexity, i.e. the minimal number of random training samples allowing a selection of the hypothesis with a predefined accuracy and confidence. Further, we show that the model has the poten tial for providing a finite sample complexity even in the case of infinite VC-dimension as well as for a sample complexity below VC-dimension. This is achieved by linking sample complexity to an ""average"" number of implement able dichotomies of a training sample rather than the maximal size of a shattered sample, i.e. VC-dimension. 1 Introduction A number offundamental results in computational learning theory [1, 2, 11] links the generalisation error achievable by a set of hypotheses with its Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension (VC-dimension, for short",Optimization & Theoretical ML,8b5040a8a5baf3e0e67386c2e3a9b903-Paper.pdf,1994

Capacity and Information Efficiency of a,"We have determined the capacity and information efficiency of an associative net configured in a brain-like way with partial connec tivity and noisy input cues.

For moderately sparse pat terns, maximum information efficiency is achieved with very low connectivity levels (~ 10%). This corresponds to the level of con nectivity commonly seen in the brain and invites speculation that the brain is connected in the most information efficient way. 1 INTRODUCTION Standard network associative memories become more plausible as models of asso ciative memory in the brain if they incorporate (1) partial connectivity, (2) sparse activity and (3) recall from noisy cues.

A Non-linear Information Maximisation,"A new learning algorithm is derived which performs online stochas tic gradient ascent in the mutual information between outputs and inputs of a network. In the absence of a priori knowledge about the 'signal' and 'noise' components of the input, propagation of information depends on calibrating network non-linearities to the detailed higher-order moments of the input density functions. By incidentally minimising mutual information between outputs, as well as maximising their individual entropies, the network 'fac torises' the input into independent components.

On-line Learning of Dichotomies,"The performance of on-line algorithms for learning dichotomies is studied. In on-line learn ing, the number of examples P is equivalent to the learning time, since each example is presented only once. The learning curve, or generalization error as a function of P, depends on the schedule at which the learning rate is lowered. For a target that is a perceptron rule, the learning curve of the perceptron algorithm can decrease as fast as p-1, if the sched ule is optimized. If the target is not realizable by a perceptron, the perceptron algorithm does not generally converge to the solution with lowest generalization error. For the case of unrealizability due to a simple output noise, we propose a new on-line algorithm for a perceptron yielding a learning curve that can approach the optimal generalization error as fast as p-l/2. We then generalize the perceptron algorithm to any class of thresholded smooth functions learning a target from that class.

The K-Means algorithm can be de scribed either as a gradient descent algorithm or by slightly extend ing the mathematics of the EM algorithm to this hard threshold case. We show that the K-Means algorithm actually minimizes the quantization error using the very fast Newton algorithm. 1 INTRODUCTION K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm used in many applications, including the initialization of more computationally expensive algorithms (Gaussian mixtures, Radial Basis Functions, Learning Vector Quantization and some Hidden Markov Models). The practice of this initialization procedure often gives the frustrating feeling that K-Means performs most of the task in a small fraction of the overall time. This motivated us to better understand this convergence speed.

One expensive solution to this problem is to gather more training data in an attempt to sample these outlier users. A second solution, explored in this paper, is to artificially enlarge the number of training talkers by transforming the speech of existing training talkers. This approach is similar to enlarging the training set for OCR digit recognition by warping the training digit images, but is more difficult because continuous speech has a much larger number of dimensions (e.g. linguistic, phonetic, style, temporal, spectral) that differ across talkers.

Direction Selectivity In Primary Visual,"Almost all models of orientation and direction selectivity in visual cortex are based on feedforward connection schemes, where genicu late input provides all excitation to both pyramidal and inhibitory neurons. The latter neurons then suppress the response of the for mer for non-optimal stimuli. However, anatomical studies show that up to 90 % of the excitatory synaptic input onto any corti cal cell is provided by other cortical cells. The massive excitatory feedback nature of cortical circuits is embedded in the canonical microcircuit of Douglas &. Martin (1991). We here investigate ana lytically and through biologically realistic simulations the function ing of a detailed model of this circuitry, operating in a hysteretic mode. In the model, weak geniculate input is dramatically ampli fied by intracortical excitation, while inhibition has a dual role: (i) to prevent the early geniculate-induced excitation in the null di rection and (ii) to restrain excitation and ensure that the neur",Computer Vision,a64c94baaf368e1840a1324e839230de-Paper.pdf,1994
Bayesian Query Construction for Neural,"If data collection is costly, there is much to be gained by actively se lecting particularly informative data points in a sequential way. In a Bayesian decision-theoretic framework we develop a query selec tion criterion which explicitly takes into account the intended use of the model predictions. By Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods the necessary quantities can be approximated to a desired preci sion. As the number of data points grows, the model complexity is modified by a Bayesian model selection strategy. The proper ties of two versions of the criterion ate demonstrated in numerical experiments. 1 INTRODUCTION In this paper we consider the situation where data collection is costly, as when for example, real measurements or technical experiments have to be performed. In this situation the approach of query learning ('active data selection', 'sequential experimental design', etc.) has a potential benefit. Depending on the previously seen examples, a new input value ('query') is selec",Optimization & Theoretical ML,a9b7ba70783b617e9998dc4dd82eb3c5-Paper.pdf,1994
A Silicon Axon,"We present a silicon model of an axon which shows promise as a building block for pulse-based neural computations involving cor relations of pulses across both space and time. The circuit shares a number of features with its biological counterpart including an excitation threshold, a brief refractory period after pulse comple tion, pulse amplitude restoration, and pulse width restoration. We provide a simple explanation of circuit operation and present data from a chip fabricated in a standard 2Jlm CMOS process through the MOS Implementation Service (MOSIS). We emphasize the ne cessity of the restoration of the width of the pulse in time for stable propagation in axons. 1 INTRODUCTION It is well known that axons are neural processes specialized for transmitting infor mation over relatively long distances in the nervous system.

Plasticity-Mediated Competitive Learning,"Differentiation between the nodes of a competitive learning net work is conventionally achieved through competition on the ba sis of neural activity. Simple inhibitory mechanisms are limited to sparse representations, while decorrelation and factorization schemes that support distributed representations are computation ally unattractive. By letting neural plasticity mediate the compet itive interaction instead, we obtain diffuse, nonadaptive alterna tives for fully distributed representations. We use this technique to Simplify and improve our binary information gain optimiza tion algorithm for feature extraction (Schraudolph and Sejnowski, 1993); the same approach could be used to improve other learning algorithms. 1 INTRODUCTION Unsupervised neural networks frequently employ sets of nodes or subnetworks with identical architecture and objective function. Some form of competitive inter action is then needed for these nodes to differentiate and efficiently complement each other in their",Deep Learning,aa68c75c4a77c87f97fb686b2f068676-Paper.pdf,1994
Active Learning for Function,"We develop a principled strategy to sample a function optimally for function approximation tasks within a Bayesian framework. Using ideas from optimal experiment design, we introduce an objective function (incorporating both bias and variance) to measure the de gree of approximation, and the potential utility of the data points towards optimizing this objective. We show how the general strat egy can be used to derive precise algorithms to select data for two cases: learning unit step functions and polynomial functions. In particular, we investigate whether such active algorithms can learn the target with fewer examples. We obtain theoretical and empir ical results to suggest that this is the case. 1 INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION Learning from examples is a common supervised learning paradigm that hypothe sizes a target concept given a stream of training examples that describes the concept.

A Study of Parallel Perturbative,"We have continued our study of a parallel perturbative learning method [Alspector et al., 1993] and implications for its implemen tation in analog VLSI. Our new results indicate that, in most cases, a single parallel perturbation (per pattern presentation) of the func tion parameters (weights in a neural network) is theoretically the best course. This is not true, however, for certain problems and may not generally be true when faced with issues of implemen tation such as limited precision. In these cases, multiple parallel perturbations may be best as indicated in our previous results. 1 INTRODUCTION Motivated by difficulties in analog VLSI implementation of back-propagation [Rumelhart et al., 1986] and related algorithms that calculate gradients based on detailed knowledge of the neural network model, there were several similar re cent papers proposing to use a parallel [Alspector et al., 1993, Cauwenberghs, 1993, Kirk et al., 1993] or a semi-parallel [Flower and Jabri, 1993] perturb",Optimization & Theoretical ML,b56a18e0eacdf51aa2a5306b0f533204-Paper.pdf,1994
A Neural Model of Delusions and,"We implement and study a computational model of Stevens' [19921 theory of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. This theory hypoth esizes that the onset of schizophrenia is associated with reactive synaptic regeneration occurring in brain regions receiving degener ating temporal lobe projections. Concentrating on one such area, the frontal cortex, we model a frontal module as an associative memory neural network whose input synapses represent incoming temporal projections. We analyze how, in the face of weakened external input projections, compensatory strengthening of internal synaptic connections and increased noise levels can maintain mem ory capacities (which are generally preserved in schizophrenia). However, These compensatory changes adversely lead to sponta neous, biased retrieval of stored memories, which corresponds to the occurrence of schizophrenic delusions and hallucinations with out any apparent external trigger, and for their tendency to con centrate on just few central th",NLP,b6a1085a27ab7bff7550f8a3bd017df8-Paper.pdf,1994
Correlation and Interpolation Networks for,"We describe a framework for real-time tracking of facial expressions that uses neurally-inspired correlation and interpolation methods. A distributed view-based representation is used to characterize facial state, and is computed using a replicated correlation network. The ensemble response of the set of view correlation scores is input to a network based interpolation method, which maps perceptual state to motor control states for a simulated 3-D face model. Activation levels of the motor state correspond to muscle activations in an anatomically derived model. By integrating fast and robust 2-D processing with 3-D models, we obtain a system that is able to quickly track and interpret complex facial motions in real-time. 1 INTRODUCTION An important task for natural and artificial vision systems is the analysis and interpretation of faces.

"Neural Network Ensembles, Cross","Learning of continuous valued functions using neural network en sembles (committees) can give improved accuracy, reliable estima tion of the generalization error, and active learning. The ambiguity is defined as the variation of the output of ensemble members aver aged over unlabeled data, so it quantifies the disagreement among the networks. It is discussed how to use the ambiguity in combina tion with cross-validation to give a reliable estimate of the ensemble generalization error, and how this type of ensemble cross-validation can sometimes improve performance. It is shown how to estimate the optimal weights of the ensemble members using unlabeled data. By a generalization of query by committee, it is finally shown how the ambiguity can be used to select new training data to be labeled in an active learning scheme. 1 INTRODUCTION It is well known that a combination of many different predictors can improve predic tions.

Extracting Rules from Artificial Neural Networks,"Although artificial neural networks have been applied in a variety of real-world scenarios with remarkable success, they have often been criticized for exhibiting a low degree of human comprehensibility. Techniques that compile compact sets of symbolic rules out of artificial neural networks offer a promising perspective to overcome this obvious deficiency of neural network representations. This paper presents an approach to the extraction of if-then rules from artificial neu ral networks. Its key mechanism is validity interval analysis, which is a generic tool for extracting symbolic knowledge by propagating rule-like knowledge through Backpropagation-style neural networks. Empirical studies in a robot arm domain illus trate the appropriateness of the proposed method for extracting rules from networks with real-valued and distributed representations. 1 Introduction In the last few years artificial neural networks have been applied successfully to a variety of real-world problems.

A model of the hippocampus combining self,"A model of the hippocampus is presented which forms rapid self- orga nized representations of input arriving via the perforant path, performs recall of previous associations in region CA3, and performs comparison of this recall with afferent input in region CA 1. This comparison drives feedback regulation of cholinergic modulation to set appropriate dynamics for learning of new representations in region CA3 and CA 1. The network responds to novel patterns with increased cholinergic mod ulation, allowing storage of new self-organized representations, but responds to familiar patterns with a decrease in acetylcholine, allowing recall based on previous representations. This requires selectivity of the cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in stratum radiatum of regions CA3 and CAl, which has been demonstrated experimentally. 1 INTRODUCTION A number of models of hippocampal function have been developed (Burgess et aI., 1994; Myers and Gluck, 1994; Touretzky et al., 1994), but re",NLP,c22abfa379f38b5b0411bc11fa9bf92f-Paper.pdf,1994
Glove-TalkII: Mapping Hand Gestures to,"Glove-TaikII is a system which translates hand gestures to speech through an adaptive interface. Hand gestures are mapped contin uously to 10 control parameters of a parallel formant speech syn thesizer. The mapping allows the hand to act as an artificial vocal tract that produces speech in real time. This gives an unlimited vocabulary in addition to direct control of fundamental frequency and volume. Currently, the best version of Glove-TalkII uses sev eral input devices (including a CyberGlove, a ContactGlove, a 3- space tracker, and a foot-pedal), a parallel formant speech synthe sizer and 3 neural networks. The gesture-to-speech task is divided into vowel and consonant production by using a gating network to weight the outputs of a vowel and a consonant neural network.

Learning in large linear perceptrons and,"We present a new method for obtaining the response function 9 and its average G from which most of the properties of learning and generalization in linear perceptrons can be derived. We first rederive the known results for the 'thermodynamic limit' of infinite perceptron size N and show explicitly that 9 is self-averaging in this limit. We then discuss extensions of our method to more gen eral learning scenarios with anisotropic teacher space priors, input distributions, and weight decay terms. Finally, we use our method to calculate the finite N corrections of order 1/N to G and discuss the corresponding finite size effects on generalization and learning dynamics. An important spin-off is the observation that results obtained in the thermodynamic limit are often directly relevant to systems of fairly modest, 'real-world' sizes. 1 INTRODUCTION One of the main areas of research within the Neural Networks community is the issue of learning and generalization.

Learning Saccadic Eye Movements,We describe a framework for learning saccadic eye movements using a photometric representation of target points in natural scenes. The rep resentation takes the form of a high-dimensional vector comprised of the responses of spatial filters at different orientations and scales. We first demonstrate the use of this response vector in the task of locating pre viously foveated points in a scene and subsequently use this property in a multisaccade strategy to derive an adaptive motor map for delivering accurate saccades. 1 Introduction There has been recent interest in the use of space-variant sensors in active vision systems for tasks such as visual search and object tracking [14]. Such sensors realize the simultane ous need for wide field-of-view and good visual acuity.

Boosting the Performance,"Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks, also known as networks of locally-tuned processing units (see [6]) are well known for their ease of use. Most algorithms used to train these types of net works, however, require a fixed architecture, in which the number of units in the hidden layer must be determined before training starts. The RCE training algorithm, introduced by Reilly, Cooper and Elbaum (see [8]), and its probabilistic extension, the P-RCE algorithm, take advantage of a growing structure in which hidden units are only introduced when necessary. The nature of these al gorithms allows training to reach stability much faster than is the case for gradient-descent based methods. Unfortunately P-RCE networks do not adjust the standard deviation of their prototypes individually, using only one global value for this parameter.

An Alternative Model for Mixtures of,"We propose an alternative model for mixtures of experts which uses a different parametric form for the gating network. The modified model is trained by the EM algorithm. In comparison with earlier models-trained by either EM or gradient ascent-there is no need to select a learning stepsize. We report simulation experiments which show that the new architecture yields faster convergence. We also apply the new model to two problem domains: piecewise nonlinear function approximation and the combination of multiple previously trained classifiers. 1 INTRODUCTION For the mixtures of experts architecture (Jacobs, Jordan, Nowlan & Hinton, 1991), the EM algorithm decouples the learning process in a manner that fits well with the modular structure and yields a considerably improved rate of convergence (Jordan & Jacobs, 1994).

Catastrophic Interference in Human,"Biological sensorimotor systems are not static maps that transform input (sensory information) into output (motor behavior). Evi dence from many lines of research suggests that their representa tions are plastic, experience-dependent entities. While this plastic ity is essential for flexible behavior, it presents the nervous system with difficult organizational challenges. If the sensorimotor system adapts itself to perform well under one set of circumstances, will it then perform poorly when placed in an environment with different demands (negative transfer)? Will a later experience-dependent change undo the benefits of previous learning (catastrophic inter ference)? We explore the first question in a separate paper in this volume (Shadmehr et al. 1995). Here we present psychophysical and computational results that explore the question of catastrophic interference in the context of a dynamic motor learning task.

The technique works on noisy point sets that may be of unequal sizes and may differ by non-rigid transformations.

Morphogenesis of the Lateral Geniculate,"The macaque lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) exhibits an intricate lamination pattern, which changes midway through the nucleus at a point coincident with small gaps due to the blind spot in the retina. We present a three-dimensional model of morphogenesis in which local cell interactions cause a wave of development of neuronal re ceptive fields to propagate through the nucleus and establish two distinct lamination patterns. We examine the interactions between the wave and the localized singularities due to the gaps, and find that the gaps induce the change in lamination pattern. We explore critical factors which determine general LGN organization. 1 INTRODUCTION Each side of the mammalian brain contains a structure called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), which receives visual input from both eyes and sends projections to 134 Svilen Tzonev, Klaus Schulten, Joseph G.

Reinforcement Learning Predicts the Site,"The auditory system of the barn owl contains several spatial maps. In young barn owls raised with optical prisms over their eyes, these auditory maps are shifted to stay in register with the visual map, suggesting that the visual input imposes a frame of reference on the auditory maps. However, the optic tectum, the first site of convergence of visual with auditory information, is not the site of plasticity for the shift of the auditory maps; the plasticity occurs instead in the inferior colliculus, which contains an auditory map and projects into the optic tectum. We explored a model of the owl remapping in which a global reinforcement signal whose delivery is controlled by visual foveation.

The all optical network is feed-forward and is composed of thin layers of a Kerr type self focusing/defocusing nonlinear optical material. The training method is derived from a Lagrangian formulation of the constrained minimization of the network error at the output. This leads to a formulation that describes training as a calculation of the distributed error of the optical signal at the output which is then reflected back through the device to assign a spatially distributed error to the internal layers. This error is then used to modify the internal weighting values.

Temporal Dynamics of Generalization â¢,"This paper presents a rigorous characterization of how a general nonlinear learning machine generalizes during the training process when it is trained on a random sample using a gradient descent algorithm based on reduction of training error. It is shown, in particular, that best generalization performance occurs, in general, before the global minimum of the training error is achieved. The different roles played by the complexity of the machine class and the complexity of the specific machine in the class during learning are also precisely demarcated. 1 INTRODUCTION In learning machines such as neural networks, two major factors that affect the 'goodness of fit' of the examples are network size (complexity) and training time. These are also the major factors that affect the generalization performance of the network. Many theoretical studies exploring the relation between generalization performance and machine complexity support the parsimony heuristics suggested by Occam's ra zor, to w",Optimization & Theoretical ML,da0d1111d2dc5d489242e60ebcbaf988-Paper.pdf,1994
Learning Stochastic Perceptrons Under,"We present a statistical method that PAC learns the class of stochastic perceptrons with arbitrary monotonic activation func tion and weights Wi E {-I, 0, + I} when the probability distribution that generates the input examples is member of a family that we call k-blocking distributions. Such distributions represent an impor tant step beyond the case where each input variable is statistically independent since the 2k-blocking family contains all the Markov distributions of order k. By stochastic percept ron we mean a per ceptron which, upon presentation of input vector x, outputs 1 with probability fCLJi WiXi - B). Because the same algorithm works for any monotonic (nondecreasing or nonincreasing) activation func tion f on Boolean domain, it handles the well studied cases of sigmolds and the ""usual"" radial basis functions. 1 INTRODUCTION Within recent years, the field of computational learning theory has emerged to pro vide a rigorous framework for the design and analysis of learning a",Optimization & Theoretical ML,dd8eb9f23fbd362da0e3f4e70b878c16-Paper.pdf,1994
Recurrent Networks:,"Second order properties of cost functions for recurrent networks are investigated. We analyze a layered fully recurrent architecture, the virtue of this architecture is that it features the conventional feedforward architecture as a special case. A detailed description of recursive computation of the full Hessian of the network cost func tion is provided. We discuss the possibility of invoking simplifying approximations of the Hessian and show how weight decays iron the cost function and thereby greatly assist training. We present tenta tive pruning results, using Hassibi et al.'s Optimal Brain Surgeon, demonstrating that recurrent networks can construct an efficient internal memory. 1 LEARNING IN RECURRENT NETWORKS Time series processing is an important application area for neural networks and numerous architectures have been suggested, see e.g. (Weigend and Gershenfeld, 94).

Satoshi Suzuki Hiroshi Ando,"This paper presents an unsupervised learning scheme for categorizing 3D objects from their 2D projected images. The scheme exploits an auto-associative network's ability to encode each view of a single object into a representation that indicates its view direction. We propose two models that employ different classification mechanisms; the first model selects an auto-associative network whose recovered view best matches the input view, and the second model is based on a modular architecture whose additional network classifies the views by splitting the input space nonlinearly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed classification models through simulations using 3D wire-frame objects. 1 INTRODUCTION The human visual system can recognize various 3D (three-dimensional) objects from their 2D (two-dimensional) retinal images although the images vary significantly as the viewpoint changes.

"Hyperparameters, Evidence and","Using a statistical mechanical formalism we calculate the evidence, generalisation error and consistency measure for a linear percep tron trained and tested on a set of examples generated by a non linear teacher. The teacher is said to be unrealisable because the student can never model it without error. Our model allows us to interpolate between the known case of a linear teacher, and an un realisable, nonlinear teacher. A comparison of the hyperparameters which maximise the evidence with those that optimise the perfor mance measures reveals that, in the non-linear case, the evidence procedure is a misleading guide to optimising performance. Finally, we explore the extent to which the evidence procedure is unreliable and find that, despite being sub-optimal, in some circumstances it might be a useful method for fixing the hyperparameters. 1 INTRODUCTION The analysis of supervised learning or learning from examples is a major field of research within neural networks.

Adaptive Elastic Input Field for,"For machines to perform classification tasks, such as speech and character recognition, appropriately handling deformed patterns is a key to achieving high performance. The authors presents a new type of classification system, an Adaptive Input Field Neu ral Network (AIFNN), which includes a simple pre-trained neural network and an elastic input field attached to an input layer. By using an iterative method, AIFNN can determine an optimal affine translation for an elastic input field to compensate for the original deformations. The convergence of the AIFNN algorithm is shown. AIFNN is applied for handwritten numerals recognition. Conse quently, 10.83% of originally misclassified patterns are correctly categorized and total performance is improved, without modifying the neural network. 1 Introduction For machines to accomplish classification tasks, such as speech and character recog nition, appropriately handling deformed patterns is a key to achieving high perfor mance [Simard 92] [Sim",Computer Vision,e744f91c29ec99f0e662c9177946c627-Paper.pdf,1994
A Model for Chemosensory Reception,"A new model for chemosensory reception is presented. It models reacti ons between odor molecules and receptor proteins and the activation of second messenger by receptor proteins. The mathematical formulation of the reaction kinetics is transformed into an artificial neural network (ANN). The resulting feed-forward network provides a powerful means for parameter fitting by applying learning algorithms. The weights of the network corresponding to chemical parameters can be trained by presen ting experimental data. We demonstrate the simulation capabilities of the model with experimental data from honey bee chemosensory neurons. It can be shown that our model is sufficient to rebuild the observed data and that simpler models are not able to do this task. 1 INTRODUCTION Terrestrial animals, vertebrates and invertebrates, have developed very similar solutions for the problem of recognizing volatile substances [Vogt et ai., 1989].

A Real Time Clustering CMOS,"We describe an analog VLSI implementation of the ARTI algorithm (Carpenter, 1987). A prototype chip has been fabricated in a standard low cost 1.5~m double-metal single-poly CMOS process. It has a die area of lcm2 and is mounted in a 12O-pins PGA package. The chip realizes a modified version of the original ARTI architecture. Such modification has been shown to preserve all computational properties of the original algorithm (Serrano, 1994a), while being more appropriate for VLSI realizations. The chip implements an ARTI network with 100 F1 nodes and 18 F2 nodes. It can therefore cluster 100 binary pixels input patterns into up to 18 different categories. Modular expansibility of the system is possible by assembling an NxM array of chips without any extra interfacing circuitry, resulting in an F 1 layer with l00xN nodes, and an F2 layer with 18xM nodes.

Learning from queries for maximum,"In supervised learning, learning from queries rather than from random examples can improve generalization performance signif icantly. We study the performance of query learning for problems where the student cannot learn the teacher perfectly, which occur frequently in practice. As a prototypical scenario of this kind, we consider a linear perceptron student learning a binary perceptron teacher. Two kinds of queries for maximum information gain, i.e., minimum entropy, are investigated: Minimum student space en tropy (MSSE) queries, which are appropriate if the teacher space is unknown, and minimum teacher space entropy (MTSE) queries, which can be used if the teacher space is assumed to be known, but a student of a simpler form has deliberately been chosen. We find that for MSSE queries, the structure of the student space deter mines the efficacy of query learning, whereas MTSE queries lead to a higher generalization error than random examples, due to a lack of feedback about the progr",Optimization & Theoretical ML,eeb69a3cb92300456b6a5f4162093851-Paper.pdf,1994
Factorial Learning by Clustering Features,"We introduce a novel algorithm for factorial learning, motivated by segmentation problems in computational vision, in which the underlying factors correspond to clusters of highly correlated input features. The algorithm derives from a new kind of competitive clustering model, in which the cluster generators compete to ex plain each feature of the data set and cooperate to explain each input example, rather than competing for examples and cooper ating on features, as in traditional clustering algorithms. A natu ral extension of the algorithm recovers hierarchical models of data generated from multiple unknown categories, each with a differ ent, multiple causal structure. Several simulations demonstrate the power of this approach. 1 INTRODUCTION Unsupervised learning is the search for structure in data. Most unsupervised learn ing systems can be viewed as trying to invert a particular generative model of the data in order to recover the underlying causal structure of their world.

Generalization in Reinforcement Learning:,"A straightforward approach to the curse of dimensionality in re inforcement learning and dynamic programming is to replace the lookup table with a generalizing function approximator such as a neu ral net. Although this has been successful in the domain of backgam mon, there is no guarantee of convergence. In this paper, we show that the combination of dynamic programming and function approx imation is not robust, and in even very benign cases, may produce an entirely wrong policy. We then introduce Grow-Support, a new algorithm which is safe from divergence yet can still reap the benefits of successful generalization. 1 INTRODUCTION Reinforcement learning-the problem of getting an agent to learn to act from sparse, delayed rewards-has been advanced by techniques based on dynamic programming (DP). These algorithms compute a value function which gives, for each state, the min imum possible long-term cost commencing in that state.

A Rapid Graph-based Method for,"We present a graph-based method for rapid, accurate search through prototypes for transformation-invariant pattern classifica tion. Our method has in theory the same recognition accuracy as other recent methods based on ''tangent distance"" [Simard et al., 1994], since it uses the same categorization rule. Nevertheless ours is significantly faster during classification because far fewer tan gent distances need be computed. Crucial to the success of our system are 1) a novel graph architecture in which transformation constraints and geometric relationships among prototypes are en coded during learning, and 2) an improved graph search criterion, used during classification. These architectural insights are applica ble to a wide range of problem domains.

A solvable connectionist model of,"A model of short-term memory for serially ordered lists of verbal stimuli is proposed as an implementation of the 'articulatory loop' thought to mediate this type of memory (Baddeley, 1986). The model predicts the presence of a repeatable time-varying 'context' signal coding the timing of items' presentation in addition to a store of phonological information and a process of serial rehearsal. Items are associated with context nodes and phonemes by Hebbian connections showing both short and long term plasticity. Items are activated by phonemic input during presentation and reactivated by context and phonemic feedback during output. Serial selection of items occurs via a winner-take-all interaction amongst items, with the winner subsequently receiving decaying inhibition. An approximate analysis of error probabilities due to Gaussian noise during output is presented. The model provides an explanatory account of the probability of error as a function of serial position, list length, word ",NLP,f47d0ad31c4c49061b9e505593e3db98-Paper.pdf,1994

How ever, there are severe search problems associated with fitting the models to data. We show that by using neural networks to provide better starting points, the search time can be significantly reduced. The method is demonstrated on a character recognition task. In previous work we have developed an approach to handwritten character recogni tion based on the use of deformable models (Hinton, Williams and Revow, 1992a; Revow, Williams and Hinton, 1993). We have obtained good performance with this method, but a major problem is that the search procedure for fitting each model to an image is very computationally intensive, because there is no efficient algorithm (like dynamic programming) for this task.

Coarse-to-Fine Image Search Using Neural,"The efficiency of image search can be greatly improved by using a coarse-to-fine search strategy with a multi-resolution image representa tion. However, if the resolution is so low that the objects have few dis tinguishing features, search becomes difficult. We show that the performance of search at such low resolutions can be improved by using context information, i.e., objects visible at low-resolution which are not the objects of interest but are associated with them. The networks can be given explicit context information as inputs, or they can learn to detect the context objects, in which case the user does not have to be aware of their existence. We also use Integrated Feature Pyramids, which repre sent high-frequency information at low resolutions. The use of multi resolution search techniques allows us to combine information about the appearance of the objects on many scales in an efficient way.

Learning to Predict,"Visual occlusion events constitute a major source of depth information. This paper presents a self-organizing neural network that learns to detect, represent, and predict the visibility and invisibility relationships that arise during occlusion events, after a period of exposure to motion sequences containing occlusion and disocclusion events. The network develops two parallel opponent channels or ""chains"" of lateral excitatory connections for every resolvable motion trajectory. One channel, the ""On"" chain or ""visible"" chain, is activated when a moving stimulus is visible. The other channel, the ""Off"" chain or ""invisible"" chain, carries a persistent, amodal representation that predicts the motion of a formerly visible stimulus that becomes invisible due to occlusion. The learning rule uses disinhibition from the On chain to trigger learning in the Off chain. The On and Off chain neurons can learn separate associations with object depth or dering.

Onset-based Sound Segmentation,"A technique for segmenting sounds using processing based on mam malian early auditory processing is presented. The technique is based on features in sound which neuron spike recording suggests are detected in the cochlear nucleus. The sound signal is band passed and each signal processed to enhance onsets and offsets. The onset and offset signals are compressed, then clustered both in time and across frequency channels using a network of integrate and-fire neurons. Onsets and offsets are signalled by spikes, and the timing of these spikes used to segment the sound. 1 Background Traditional speech interpretation techniques based on Fourier transforms, spectrum recoding, and a hidden Markov model or neural network interpretation stage have limitations both in continuous speech and in interpreting speech in the presence of noise, and this has led to interest in front ends modelling biological auditory systems for speech interpretation systems (Ainsworth and Meyer 92; Cosi 93; Cole et al 9",Computer Vision,021bbc7ee20b71134d53e20206bd6feb-Paper.pdf,1995

A Neural Network Autoassociator for,"We present results on the use of neural network based autoassociators which act as novelty or anomaly detectors to detect imminent motor failures. The autoassociator is trained to reconstruct spectra obtained from the healthy motor. In laboratory tests, we have demonstrated that the trained autoassociator has a small reconstruction error on measurements recorded from healthy motors but a larger error on those recorded from a motor with a fault. We have designed and built a motor monitoring system using an autoassociator for anomaly detection and are in the process of testing the system at three industrial and commercial sites. 1 Introduction An unexpected breakdown of an electric induction motor can cause financial loss signif icantly in excess of the cost of the motor.

Laterally Interconnected Self-Organizing,"An application of laterally interconnected self-organizing maps (LISSOM) to handwritten digit recognition is presented. The lat eral connections learn the correlations of activity between units on the map. The resulting excitatory connections focus the activity into local patches and the inhibitory connections decorrelate redun dant activity on the map. The map thus forms internal representa tions that are easy to recognize with e.g. a perceptron network. The recognition rate on a subset of NIST database 3 is 4.0% higher with LISSOM than with a regular Self-Organizing Map (SOM) as the front end, and 15.8% higher than recognition of raw input bitmaps directly. These results form a promising starting point for building pattern recognition systems with a LISSOM map as a front end. 1 Introduction Hand-written digit recognition has become one of the touchstone problems in neural networks recently.

A Model of Spatial Representations in,"We have recently developed a theory of spatial representations in which the position of an object is not encoded in a particular frame of reference but, instead, involves neurons computing basis func tions of their sensory inputs. This type of representation is able to perform nonlinear sensorimotor transformations and is consis tent with the response properties of parietal neurons. We now ask whether the same theory could account for the behavior of human patients with parietal lesions. These lesions induce a deficit known as hemineglect that is characterized by a lack of reaction to stimuli located in the hemispace contralateral to the lesion. A simulated lesion in a basis function representation was found to replicate three of the most important aspects of hemineglect: i) The models failed to cross the leftmost lines in line cancellation experiments, ii) the deficit affected multiple frames of reference and, iii) it could be object centered.

Temporal Difference Learning in,"A continuous-time, continuous-state version of the temporal differ ence (TD) algorithm is derived in order to facilitate the application of reinforcement learning to real-world control tasks and neurobi ological modeling. An optimal nonlinear feedback control law was also derived using the derivatives of the value function. The per formance of the algorithms was tested in a task of swinging up a pendulum with limited torque. Both the ""critic"" that specifies the paths to the upright position and the ""actor"" that works as a non linear feedback controller were successfully implemented by radial basis function (RBF) networks. 1 INTRODUCTION The temporal-difference (TD) algorithm (Sutton, 1988) for delayed reinforcement learning has been applied to a variety of tasks, such as robot navigation, board games, and biological modeling (Houk et al., 1994). Elucidation of the relationship between TD learning and dynamic programming (DP) has provided good theoretical insights (Barto et al., 1995).

Improving Policies without Measuring,"Performing policy iteration in dynamic programming should only require knowledge of relative rather than absolute measures of the utility of actions (Werbos, 1991) - what Baird (1993) calls the ad vantages of actions at states. Nevertheless, most existing methods in dynamic programming (including Baird's) compute some form of absolute utility function. For smooth problems, advantages satisfy two differential consistency conditions (including the requirement that they be free of curl), and we show that enforcing these can lead to appropriate policy improvement solely in terms of advantages. 1 Introd uction In deciding how to change a policy at a state, an agent only needs to know the differences (called advantages) between the total return based on taking each action a for one step and then following the policy forever after, and the total return based on always following the policy (the conventional value of the state under the policy). The advantages are like differentials - they do n",Optimization & Theoretical ML,208e43f0e45c4c78cafadb83d2888cb6-Paper.pdf,1995
Selective Attention for Handwritten,"Completely parallel object recognition is NP-complete. Achieving a recognizer with feasible complexity requires a compromise be tween parallel and sequential processing where a system selectively focuses on parts of a given image, one after another. Successive fixations are generated to sample the image and these samples are processed and abstracted to generate a temporal context in which results are integrated over time. A computational model based on a partially recurrent feedforward network is proposed and made cred ible by testing on the real-world problem of recognition of hand written digits with encouraging results. 1 INTRODUCTION For all-parallel bottom-up recognition, allocating one separate unit for each possible feature combination, i.e., conjunctive encoding, implies combinatorial explosion. It has been shown that completely parallel, bottom-up visual object recognition is NP-complete (Tsotsos, 1990). By exchanging space with time, systems with much less complexity may be d",Computer Vision,20b5e1cf8694af7a3c1ba4a87f073021-Paper.pdf,1995
Learning Model Bias,"In this paper the problem of learning appropriate domain-specific bias is addressed. It is shown that this can be achieved by learning many related tasks from the same domain, and a theorem is given bounding the number tasks that must be learnt. A corollary of the theorem is that if the tasks are known to possess a common inter nal representation or preprocessing then the number of examples required per task for good generalisation when learning n tasks si multaneously scales like O(a + ~), where O(a) is a bound on the minimum number of examples requred to learn a single task, and O( a + b) is a bound on the number of examples required to learn each task independently. An experiment providing strong qualita tive support for the theoretical results is reported. 1 Introduction It has been argued (see [6]) that the main problem in machine learning is the biasing of a learner's hypothesis space sufficiently well to ensure good generalisation from a small number of examples.

Tempering Backpropagation Networks:,"Backpropagation learning algorithms typically collapse the network's structure into a single vector of weight parameters to be optimized. We suggest that their performance may be improved by utilizing the struc tural information instead of discarding it, and introduce a framework for ''tempering'' each weight accordingly. In the tempering model, activation and error signals are treated as approx imately independent random variables. The characteristic scale of weight changes is then matched to that ofthe residuals, allowing structural prop erties such as a node's fan-in and fan-out to affect the local learning rate and backpropagated error. The model also permits calculation of an upper bound on the global learning rate for batch updates, which in turn leads to different update rules for bias vs. non-bias weights. This approach yields hitherto unparalleled performance on the family re lations benchmark, a deep multi-layer network: for both batch learning with momentum and the delta-bar",Deep Learning,1e6e0a04d20f50967c64dac2d639a577-Paper.pdf,1995
Estimating the Bayes Risk from Sample Data,"A new nearest-neighbor method is described for estimating the Bayes risk of a multiclass pattern claSSification problem from sample data (e.g., a classified training set). Although it is assumed that the classification prob lem can be accurately described by sufficiently smooth class-conditional distributions, neither these distributions, nor the corresponding prior prob abilities of the classes are required. Thus this method can be applied to practical problems where the underlying probabilities are not known. This method is illustrated using two different pattern recognition problems. 1 INTRODUCTION An important application of artificial neural networks is to obtain accurate solutions to pattern classification problems. In this setting, each pattern, represented as an n-dimensional feature vector, is associated with a discrete pattern class, or state of nature (Duda and Hart, 1973).

A MODEL OF AUDITORY STREAMING,"An essential feature of intelligent sensory processing is the ability to focus on the part of the signal of interest against a background of distracting signals, and to be able to direct this focus at will. In this paper the problem of auditory scene segmentation is considered and a model of the early stages of the process is proposed. The behaviour of the model is shown to be in agreement with a number of well known psychophysical results. The principal contribution of this model lies in demonstrating how streaming might result from interactions between the tonotopic patterns of activity of input signals and traces of previous activity which feedback and influence the way in which subsequent signals are processed. 1 INTRODUCTION The appropriate segmentation and grouping of incoming sensory signals is important in enabling an organism to interact effectively with its environment (Llinas, 1991).

Context-Dependent Classes in a Hybrid,"A method for incorporating context-dependent phone classes in a connectionist-HMM hybrid speech recognition system is intro duced. A modular approach is adopted, where single-layer networks discriminate between different context classes given the phone class and the acoustic data. The context networks are combined with a context-independent (CI) network to generate context-dependent (CD) phone probability estimates. Experiments show an average reduction in word error rate of 16% and 13% from the CI system on ARPA 5,000 word and SQALE 20,000 word tasks respectively. Due to improved modelling, the decoding speed of the CD system is more than twice as fast as the CI system.

Exploiting Tractable Substructures,"We develop a refined mean field approximation for inference and learning in probabilistic neural networks. Our mean field theory, unlike most, does not assume that the units behave as independent degrees of freedom; instead, it exploits in a principled way the existence of large substructures that are computationally tractable. To illustrate the advantages of this framework, we show how to incorporate weak higher order interactions into a first-order hidden Markov model, treating the corrections (but not the first order structure) within mean field theory. 1 INTRODUCTION Learning the parameters in a probabilistic neural network may be viewed as a problem in statistical estimation. In networks with sparse connectivity (e.g. trees and chains), there exist efficient algorithms for the exact probabilistic calculations that support inference and learning. In general, however, these calculations are intractable, and approximations are required.

Statistical Theory of Overtraining - Is,"A statistical theory for overtraining is proposed. The analysis treats realizable stochastic neural networks, trained with Kullback Leibler loss in the asymptotic case. It is shown that the asymptotic gain in the generalization error is small if we perform early stop ping, even if we have access to the optimal stopping time. Consider ing cross-validation stopping we answer the question: In what ratio the examples should be divided into training and testing sets in or der to obtain the optimum performance. In the non-asymptotic region cross-validated early stopping always decreases the general ization error. Our large scale simulations done on a CM5 are in nice agreement with our analytical findings. 1 Introduction Training multilayer neural feed-forward networks, there is a folklore that the gen eralization error decreases in an early period of training, reaches the minimum and then increases as training goes on, while the training error monotonically decreases.

Human Face Detection in Visual Scenes,"We present a neural network-based face detection system. A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image, and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with another state-of-the-art face detection system are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates. 1 INTRODUCTION In this paper, we present a neural network-based algorithm to detect frontal views of faces in gray-scale images.

Stochastic Hillclimbing as a Baseline,"We investigate the effectiveness of stochastic hillclimbing as a baseline for evaluating the performance of genetic algorithms (GAs) as combinato rial function optimizers. In particular, we address two problems to which GAs have been applied in the literature: Koza's ll-multiplexer problem and the jobshop problem. We demonstrate that simple stochastic hill climbing methods are able to achieve results comparable or superior to those obtained by the GAs designed to address these two problems. We further illustrate, in the case of the jobshop problem, how insights ob tained in the formulation of a stochastic hillclimbing algorithm can lead to improvements in the encoding used by a GA. 1 Introduction Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a class of randomized optimization heuristics based loosely on the biological paradigm of natural selection.

"Using the Future to ""Sort Out"" the","A patient visits the doctor; the doctor reviews the patient's history, asks questions, makes basic measurements (blood pressure, ... ), and prescribes tests or treatment. The prescribed course of action is based on an assessment of patient risk-patients at higher risk are given more and faster attention.

This paper presents two methods that together improve the accuracy of backprop nets on a pneumonia risk assessment problem by 10-50%. Rankprop improves on backpropagation with sum of squares error in ranking patients by risk.

The neuron has d weights w E Rd. The output of the neuron for an input pattern x E Rd is y = Â¢(xÂ· w), where Â¢ : R -+ R is a transfer function. For a given sequence of training examples ((Xt, Yt))I<t<m, each consisting of a pattern Xt E R d and a desired output Yt E R, the goal of the training phase for neural networks consists of minimizing the error function with respect to the weight vector w E Rd. This function is the sum of the losses between outputs of the neuron and the desired outputs summed over all training examples. In notation, the error function is Lm E(w) = L(Yt, Â¢(Xt . w)) , t=1 where L : R x R -+ [0,00) is the loss function.

Achievement of the classifier structure is quantified by an associated cost. The con strained optimization problem is equivalent to the minimization of a Helmholtz free energy, and the resulting optimization method is a basic extension of the deterministic annealing algorithm that explicitly enforces structural constraints on assignments while re ducing the entropy and expected cost with temperature.

Their states are not fully observable and they are nonstationary due to changing passenger arrival rates. In addition, we use a team of RL agents, each of which is responsible for controlling one ele vator car. The team receives a global reinforcement signal which appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the other agents, the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete observation of the state.

Recursive Estimation of Dynamic,"In this paper, recursive estimation algorithms for dynamic modular networks are developed. The models are based on Gaussian RBF networks and the gating network is considered in two stages: At first, it is simply a time-varying scalar and in the second, it is based on the state, as in the mixture of local experts scheme. The resulting algorithm uses Kalman filter estimation for the model estimation and the gating probability estimation. Both, 'hard' and 'soft' competition based estimation schemes are developed where in the former, the most probable network is adapted and in the latter all networks are adapted by appropriate weighting of the data. 1 INTRODUCTION The problem of learning multiple modes in a complex nonlinear system is increas ingly being studied by various researchers [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], The use of a mixture of local experts [5, 6], and a conditional mixture density network [3] have been devel oped to model various modes of a system.

The first layer of the neural network is a hardware linear classifier which recognizes the characters in this font.

Modeling Saccadic Targeting in Visual Search,"Visual cognition depends criticalIy on the ability to make rapid eye movements known as saccades that orient the fovea over targets of interest in a visual scene. Saccades are known to be ballistic: the pattern of muscle activation for foveating a prespecified target location is computed prior to the movement and visual feedback is precluded. Despite these distinctive properties, there has been no general model of the saccadic targeting strategy employed by the human visual system during visual search in natural scenes. This paper proposes a model for saccadic targeting that uses iconic scene representations derived from oriented spatial filters at multiple scales. Visual search proceeds in a coarse-to-fine fashion with the largest scale filter responses being compared first. The model was empirically tested by comparing its perfonnance with actual eye movement data from human subjects in a natural visual search task; preliminary results indicate substantial agreement between eye movem",Computer Vision,3fe78a8acf5fda99de95303940a2420c-Paper.pdf,1995

Furthermore, when the input pattern is corrupted by a background noise, the CSRFs of the hidden units becomes shal lower and broader with decrease of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The same kind of SNR-dependent plasticity is present in the CSRF of real visual neurons; in bipolar cells of the carp retina as is shown here experimentally, as well as in large monopolar cells of the fly compound eye as was described by others.

A linear threshold element computes a function that is a sign of a weighted sum of the input variables. The weights are arbitrary integers; actually, they can be very big integers- exponential in the number of the input variables. However, in practice, it is difficult to implement big weights. In the present literature a distinction is made between the two extreme cases: linear threshold functions with polynomial-size weights as opposed to those with exponential-size weights. The main contribution of this paper is to fill up the gap by further refining that separation. Namely, we prove that the class of linear threshold functions with polynomial-size weights can be divided into subclasses according to the degree of the polynomial. In fact, we prove a more general result- that there exists a minimal weight linear threshold function for any arbitrary number of inputs and any weight size.

The potential of a committee in improving classification performance has been well documented. Central to this improvement is the extent to which the errors tend to coincide.

The Capacity of a Bump,"Recently, several researchers have reported encouraging experimental re sults when using Gaussian or bump-like activation functions in multilayer perceptrons. Networks of this type usually require fewer hidden layers and units and often learn much faster than typical sigmoidal networks. To explain these results we consider a hyper-ridge network, which is a simple perceptron with no hidden units and a ridÂ¥e activation function. If we are interested in partitioningp points in d dimensions into two classes then in the limit as d approaches infinity the capacity of a hyper-ridge and a perceptron is identical. However, we show that for p ~ d, which is the usual case in practice, the ratio of hyper-ridge to perceptron dichotomies approaches pl2(d + 1). 1 Introduction A hyper-ridge network is a simple perceptron with no hidden units and a ridge activation = = function.

We show also that failed unlearning results in total memory breakdown. 1 INTRODUCTION In the past years the unsupervised learning schemes arose strong interest among researchers but for the time being a little is known about underlying learning mech anisms, as well as still less rigorous results like convergence theorems were obtained in this field. One of promising concepts along this line is so called ""unlearning"" for the Hopfield-type neural networks (Hopfield et ai, 1983, van Hemmen & Klem mer, 1992, Wimbauer et ai, 1994).

Forward-backward retraining of recurrent,"This paper describes the training of a recurrent neural network as the letter posterior probability estimator for a hidden Markov model, off-line handwriting recognition system. The network esti mates posterior distributions for each of a series of frames repre senting sections of a handwritten word. The supervised training algorithm, backpropagation through time, requires target outputs to be provided for each frame. Three methods for deriving these targets are presented. A novel method based upon the forward backward algorithm is found to result in the recognizer with the lowest error rate. 1 Introduction In the field of off-line handwriting recognition, the goal is to read a handwritten document and produce a machine transcription. Such a system could be used for a variety of purposes, from cheque processing and postal sorting to personal correspondence reading for the blind or historical document reading.

There are two neural network algorithms at its cme: the first network is trained to find individual characters in an alphamuneric field, while the second one perfmns the classification. Both networks were trained on Gabor projections of the ociginal pixel images, which resulted in higher recognition rates and greater noise immunity. Compared to its purely numeric counterpart (Shusurovich and Thrasher, 1995), this version of the system has a significant applicatim specific postprocessing module. The system has been implemented in specialized parallel hardware, which allows it to run at 80 char/sec/board. It has been installed at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in the United Kingdom. and its overall success rate exceeds 96% (character level without rejects). which translates into 85% field rate.

Predictive Q-Routing: A Memory-based,"In this paper, we propose a memory-based Q-Iearning algorithm called predictive Q-routing (PQ-routing) for adaptive traffic con trol. We attempt to address two problems encountered in Q-routing (Boyan & Littman, 1994), namely, the inability to fine-tune rout ing policies under low network load and the inability to learn new optimal policies under decreasing load conditions. Unlike other memory-based reinforcement learning algorithms in which mem ory is used to keep past experiences to increase learning speed, PQ-routing keeps the best experiences learned and reuses them by predicting the traffic trend. The effectiveness of PQ-routing has been verified under various network topologies and traffic con ditions. Simulation results show that PQ-routing is superior to Q-routing in terms of both learning speed and adaptability. 1 INTRODUCTION The adaptive traffic control problem is to devise routing policies for controllers (i.e. routers) operating in a non-stationary environment to minimize ",Reinforcement Learning,4e2545f819e67f0615003dd7e04a6087-Paper.pdf,1995

Modeling Interactions of the Rat's Place and,"We have developed a computational theory of rodent navigation that includes analogs of the place cell system, the head direction system, and path integration. In this paper we present simulation results showing how interactions between the place and head direction systems can account for recent observations about hippocampal place cell responses to doubling and/or rotation of cue cards in a cylindrical arena (Sharp et at., 1990). Rodents have multiple internal representations of their relationship to their environment. They have, for example, a representation of their location (place cells in the hippocampal formation, see Muller et at., 1991), and a location-independent representation of their heading (head direction cells in the postsubiculum and the anterior thalamic nuclei, see Taube et at., 1990; Taube, 1995). If these representations are to be used for navigation, they must be aligned consistently whenever the animal reenters a familiar environment.

Empirical Entropy Manipulation for,"No finite sample is sufficient to determine the density, and therefore the entropy, of a signal directly. Some assumption about either the functional form of the density or about its smoothness is necessary. Both amount to a prior over the space of possible density functions. By far the most common approach is to assume that the density has a parametric form. By contrast we derive a differential learning rule called EMMA that optimizes entropy by way of kernel density estimation. En tropy and its derivative can then be calculated by sampling from this density estimate. The resulting parameter update rule is sur prisingly simple and efficient. We will show how EMMA can be used to detect and correct cor ruption in magnetic resonance images (MRI). This application is beyond the scope of existing parametric entropy models. 1 Introduction Information theory is playing an increasing role in unsupervised learning and visual processing.

Lightness Perception,"A neural network model of 3-D lightness perception is presented which builds upon the FACADE Theory Boundary Contour Sys tem/Feature Contour System of Grossberg and colleagues. Early ratio encoding by retinal ganglion neurons as well as psychophysi cal results on constancy across different backgrounds (background constancy) are used to provide functional constraints to the theory and suggest a contrast negation hypothesis which states that ratio measures between coplanar regions are given more weight in the determination of lightness of the respective regions. Simulations of the model address data on lightness perception, including the coplanar ratio hypothesis, the Benary cross, and White's illusion. 1 INTRODUCTION Our everyday visual experience includes surface color constancy.

Adaptive Retina with Center-Surround,Both vertebrate and invertebrate retinas are highly efficient in ex tracting contrast independent of the background intensity over five or more decades. This efficiency has been rendered possible by the adaptation of the DC operating point to the background inten sity while maintaining high gain transient responses. The center surround properties of the retina allows the system to extract in formation at the edges in the image. This silicon retina models the adaptation properties of the receptors and the antagonistic center surround properties of the laminar cells of the invertebrate retina and the outer-plexiform layer of the vertebrate retina. We also illus trate the spatio-temporal responses of the silicon retina on moving bars.

Does the Wake-sleep Algorithm,"The wake-sleep algorithm (Hinton, Dayan, Frey and Neal 1995) is a rel atively efficient method of fitting a multilayer stochastic generative model to high-dimensional data. In addition to the top-down connec tions in the generative model, it makes use of bottom-up connections for approximating the probability distribution over the hidden units given the data, and it trains these bottom-up connections using a simple delta rule. We use a variety of synthetic and real data sets to compare the per formance of the wake-sleep algorithm with Monte Carlo and mean field methods for fitting the same generative model and also compare it with other models that are less powerful but easier to fit. 1 INTRODUCTION Neural networks are often used as bottom-up recognition devices that transform input vec tors into representations of those vectors in one or more hidden layers.

EM Optimization of Latent-Variable,"There is currently considerable interest in developing general non linear density models based on latent, or hidden, variables. Such models have the ability to discover the presence of a relatively small number of underlying 'causes' which, acting in combination, give rise to the apparent complexity of the observed data set. Unfortu nately, to train such models generally requires large computational effort. In this paper we introduce a novel latent variable algorithm which retains the general non-linear capabilities of previous models but which uses a training procedure based on the EM algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the model on a toy problem and on data from flow diagnostics for a multi-phase oil pipeline. 1 INTRODUCTION Many conventional approaches to density estimation, such as mixture models, rely on linear superpositions of basis functions to represent the data density.

These explicitly take into account the cor relations between the post-synaptic potentials, and thereby allow for a reliable prediction of transients. 1 INTRODUCTION Recurrent neural networks have been rather popular in the physics community, because they lend themselves so naturally to analysis with tools from equilibrium statistical mechanics. This was the main theme of physicists between, say, 1985 and 1990. Less familiar to the neural network community is a subsequent wave of theoretical physical studies, dealing with the dynamics of symmetric and nonsym metric recurrent networks. The strategy here is to try to describe the processes at a reduced level of an appropriate small set of dynamic macroscopic observables. At first, progress was made in solving the dynamics of extremely diluted models (Derrida et al, 1987) and of fully connect",NLP,58c54802a9fb9526cd0923353a34a7ae-Paper.pdf,1995
A Realizable Learning Task which,"In this paper we examine a perceptron learning task. The task is realizable since it is provided by another perceptron with identi cal architecture. Both perceptrons have nonlinear sigmoid output functions. The gain of the output function determines the level of nonlinearity of the learning task. It is observed that a high level of nonlinearity leads to overfitting. We give an explanation for this rather surprising observation and develop a method to avoid the overfitting. This method has two possible interpretations, one is learning with noise, the other cross-validated early stopping. 1 Learning Rules from Examples The property which makes feedforward neural nets interesting for many practical applications is their ability to approximate functions, which are given only by ex amples.

The region of interest is that corresponding to the super-paramagnetic one, where domains of aligned spins ap pear. The range of temperatures where these structures are stable is indicated by a non-vanishing magnetic susceptibility. We use a very efficient Monte Carlo algorithm to measure the susceptibil ity and the spin spin correlation function.

The current s.o.c. is viewed as the hidden state variable of a discrete HMM. The control dependent transition probabilities between states are modeled as parametrized functions of the mea surement. We show that their parameters can be estimated from measurements at the same time as the parameters of the movement in each s.o.c. The learning algorithm is a variant of the EM proce dure.

Visual gesture-based robot guidance,"We report on the development of the modular neural system ""SEE EAGLE"" for the visual guidance of robot pick-and-place actions. Several neural networks are integrated to a single system that vi sually recognizes human hand pointing gestures from stereo pairs of color video images. The output of the hand recognition stage is processed by a set of color-sensitive neural networks to determine the cartesian location of the target object that is referenced by the pointing gesture. Finally, this information is used to guide a robot to grab the target object and put it at another location that can be specified by a second pointing gesture. The accuracy of the cur rent system allows to identify the location of the referenced target object to an accuracy of 1 cm in a workspace area of 50x50 cm.

Prediction of Beta Sheets in Proteins,"Most current methods for prediction of protein secondary structure use a small window of the protein sequence to predict the structure of the central amino acid. We describe a new method for prediction of the non-local structure called ,8-sheet, which consists of two or more ,8-strands that are connected by hydrogen bonds. Since,8- strands are often widely separated in the protein chain, a network with two windows is introduced. After training on a set of proteins the network predicts the sheets well, but there are many false pos itives. By using a global energy function the ,8-sheet prediction is combined with a local prediction of the three secondary structures a-helix, ,8-strand and coil.

Moreover, the algorithm appears to work well in practice: on a set of three problem domains, the algorithm produces classifiers that utilize small numbers of features yet exhibit good generalization performance. Perhaps most importantly, our algorithm generates concept descriptions that are easy for humans to understand. 1 Introd uction Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) learning is a powerful method for tasks such as con cept classification. However, in many applications, such as those that may involve scientific discovery, it is crucial to be able to explain predictions. Multi-layer percep trons are limited in this regard, since their representations are notoriously difficult for humans to understand.

The Role of Activity in Synaptic,"An extended version of the dual constraint model of motor end plate morphogenesis is presented that includes activity dependent and independent competition. It is supported by a wide range of recent neurophysiological evidence that indicates a strong relation ship between synaptic efficacy and survival. The computational model is justified at the molecular level and its predictions match the developmental and regenerative behaviour of real synapses. 1 INTRODUCTION The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of mammalian skeletal muscle is one of the most extensively studied areas of the nervous system. One aspect of its develop ment that it shares with many other parts of the nervous system is its achievement of single innervation, one axon terminal connecting to one muscle fibre, after an initial state of polyinnervation. The presence of electrical activity is associated with this transition, but the exact relationship is far from clear.

Explorations with the Dynamic Wave,"Following Shrager and Johnson (1995) we study growth of logi cal function complexity in a network swept by two overlapping waves: one of pruning, and the other of Hebbian reinforcement of connections. Results indicate a significant spatial gradient in the appearance of both linearly separable and non linearly separable functions of the two inputs of the network; the n.l.s. cells are much sparser and their slope of appearance is sensitive to parameters in a highly non-linear way. 1 INTRODUCTION Both the complexity of the brain (and concomittant difficulty encoding that C0111- plexity through any direct genetic mapping). as well as the apparently high degree of cortical plasticity suggest that a great deal of cortical structure is emergent rather than pre-specified. Several neural models have explored the emergence of complexity. Von der Marlsburg (1973) studied the grouping of orientation selec tivity by competitive Hebbian synaptic modification.

Generalization in Reinforcement,"On large problems, reinforcement learning systems must use parame terized function approximators such as neural networks in order to gen eralize between similar situations and actions. In these cases there are no strong theoretical results on the accuracy of convergence, and com putational results have been mixed. In particular, Boyan and Moore reported at last year's meeting a series of negative results in attempting to apply dynamic programming together with function approximation to simple control problems with continuous state spaces. In this paper, we present positive results for all the control tasks they attempted, and for one that is significantly larger. The most important differences are that we used sparse-coarse-coded function approximators (CMACs) whereas they used mostly global function approximators, and that we learned online whereas they learned offline. Boyan and Moore and others have suggested that the problems they encountered could be solved by using actual outcome",Reinforcement Learning,8f1d43620bc6bb580df6e80b0dc05c48-Paper.pdf,1995
A Multiscale Attentional Framework for,"We investigate the optimization of neural networks governed by general objective functions. Practical formulations of such objec tives are notoriously difficult to solve; a common problem is the poor local extrema that result by any of the applied methods. In this paper, a novel framework is introduced for the solution oflarge scale optimization problems. It assumes little about the objective function and can be applied to general nonlinear, non-convex func tions; objectives in thousand of variables are thus efficiently min imized by a combination of techniques - deterministic annealing, multiscale optimization, attention mechanisms and trust region op timization methods. 1 INTRODUCTION Many practical problems in computer vision, pattern recognition, robotics and other areas can be described in terms of constrained optimization. In the past decade, researchers have proposed means of solving such problems with the use of neural networks [Hopfield & Tank, 1985; Koch et ai., 1986], which ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,93d65641ff3f1586614cf2c1ad240b6c-Paper.pdf,1995
VLSI Model of Primate Visual Smooth Pursuit,"A one dimensional model of primate smooth pursuit mechanism has been implemented in 2 11m CMOS VLSI. The model consolidates Robinson's negative feedback model with Wyatt and Pola's positive feedback scheme, to produce a smooth pursuit system which zero's the velocity of a target on the retina. Furthermore, the system uses the current eye motion as a predictor for future target motion. Analysis, stability and biological correspondence of the system are discussed. For implementation at the focal plane, a local correlation based visual motion detection technique is used. Velocity measurements, ranging over 4 orders of magnitude with < 15% variation, provides the input to the smooth pursuit system. The system performed successful velocity tracking for high contrast scenes. Circuit design and performance of the complete smooth pursuit system is presented. 1 INTRODUCTION The smooth pursuit mechanism of primate visual systems is vital for stabilizing a region of the visual field on the retina",Computer Vision,995e1fda4a2b5f55ef0df50868bf2a8f-Paper.pdf,1995
Reinforcement Learning by Probability,"We present a new algorithm for associative reinforcement learn ing. The algorithm is based upon the idea of matching a network's output probability with a probability distribution derived from the environment's reward signal. This Probability Matching algorithm is shown to perform faster and be less susceptible to local minima than previously existing algorithms. We use Probability Match ing to train mixture of experts networks, an architecture for which other reinforcement learning rules fail to converge reliably on even simple problems. This architecture is particularly well suited for our algorithm as it can compute arbitrarily complex functions yet calculation of the output probability is simple. 1 INTRODUCTION The problem of learning associative networks from scalar reinforcement signals is notoriously difficult.

Generalized Learning Vector,"We propose a new learning method, ""Generalized Learning Vec tor Quantization (GLVQ),"" in which reference vectors are updated based on the steepest descent method in order to minimize the cost function. The cost function is determined so that the obtained learning rule satisfies the convergence condition. We prove that Kohonen's rule as used in LVQ does not satisfy the convergence condition and thus degrades recognition ability. Experimental re sults for printed Chinese character recognition reveal that GLVQ is superior to LVQ in recognition ability. 1 INTRODUCTION Artificial neural network models have been applied to character recognition with good results for small-set characters such as alphanumerics (Le Cun et aI., 1989) (Yamada et al., 1989).

Bayesian Methods for Mixtures of Experts,"We present a Bayesian framework for inferring the parameters of a mixture of experts model based on ensemble learning by varia tional free energy minimisation. The Bayesian approach avoids the over-fitting and noise level under-estimation problems of traditional maximum likelihood inference. We demonstrate these methods on artificial problems and sunspot time series prediction. INTRODUCTION The task of estimating the parameters of adaptive models such as artificial neural networks using Maximum Likelihood (ML) is well documented ego Geman, Bienen stock & Doursat (1992). ML estimates typically lead to models with high variance, a process known as ""over-fitting"". ML also yields over-confident predictions; in regression problems for example, ML underestimates the noise level. This problem is particularly dominant in models where the ratio of the number of data points in the training set to the number of parameters in the model is low. In this paper we consider inference of the parameters ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,9da187a7a191431db943a9a5a6fec6f4-Paper.pdf,1995
High-Speed Airborne Particle Monitoring,"Current environmental monitoring systems assume particles to be spherical, and do not attempt to classify them. A laser-based sys tem developed at the University of Hertfordshire aims at classify ing airborne particles through the generation of two-dimensional scattering profiles. The pedormances of template matching, and two types of neural network (HyperNet and semi-linear units) are compared for image classification. The neural network approach is shown to be capable of comparable recognition pedormance, while offering a number of advantages over template matching. 1 Introduction Reliable identification of low concentrations of airborne particles requires high speed monitoring of large volumes of air, and incurs heavy computational overheads.

Adaptive Mixture of Probabilistic Transducers,"We introduce and analyze a mixture model for supervised learning of probabilistic transducers. We devise an online learning algorithm that efficiently infers the structure and estimates the parameters of each model in the mixture. Theoretical analysis and comparative simulations indicate that the learning algorithm tracks the best model from an arbitrarily large (possibly infinite) pool of models. We also present an application of the model for inducing a noun phrase recognizer. 1 Introduction Supervised learning of a probabilistic mapping between temporal sequences is an important goal of natural sequences analysis and classification with a broad range of applications such as handwriting and speech recognition, natural language processing and DNA analysis.

SEEMORE: A View-Based Approach to,"A neurally-inspired visual object recognition system is described called SEEMORE, whose goal is to identify common objects from a large known set-independent of 3-D viewiag angle, distance, and non-rigid distortion. SEEMORE's database consists of 100 ob jects that are rigid (shovel), non-rigid (telephone cord), articu lated (book), statistical (shrubbery), and complex (photographs of scenes). Recognition results were obtained using a set of 102 color and shape feature channels within a simple feedforward network ar chitecture. In response to a test set of 600 novel test views (6 of each object) presented individually in color video images, SEEMORE identified the object correctly 97% of the time (chance is 1%) using a nearest neighbor classifier. Similar levels of performance were obtained for the subset of 15 non-rigid objects.

Using Pairs of Data-Points to Define,"Conventional binary classification trees such as CART either split the data using axis-aligned hyperplanes or they perform a compu tationally expensive search in the continuous space of hyperplanes with unrestricted orientations. We show that the limitations of the former can be overcome without resorting to the latter. For every pair of training data-points, there is one hyperplane that is orthog onal to the line joining the data-points and bisects this line. Such hyperplanes are plausible candidates for splits. In a comparison on a suite of 12 datasets we found that this method of generating candidate splits outperformed the standard methods, particularly when the training sets were small. 1 Introduction Binary decision trees come in many flavours, but they all rely on splitting the set of k-dimensional data-points at each internal node into two disjoint sets.

Geometry of Early Stopping in Linear,"A theory of early stopping as applied to linear models is presented. The backpropagation learning algorithm is modeled as gradient descent in continuous time. Given a training set and a validation set, all weight vectors found by early stopping must lie on a cer tain quadric surface, usually an ellipsoid. Given a training set and a candidate early stopping weight vector, all validation sets have least-squares weights lying on a certain plane. This latter fact can be exploited to estimate the probability of stopping at any given point along the trajectory from the initial weight vector to the least squares weights derived from the training set, and to estimate the probability that training goes on indefinitely. The prospects for extending this theory to nonlinear models are discussed. 1 INTRODUCTION 'Early stopping' is the following training procedure: Split the available data into a training set and a ""validation"" set.

A Dynamical Model of Context Dependencies for the,"The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) stabilizes images on the retina during rapid head motions. The gain of the VOR (the ratio of eye to head rotation velocity) is typically around -1 when the eyes are focused on a distant target. However, to stabilize images accurately, the VOR gain must vary with context (eye position, eye vergence and head translation). We first describe a kinematic model of the VOR which relies solely on sensory information available from the semicircular canals (head rotation), the otoliths (head translation), and neural correlates of eye position and vergence angle. We then propose a dynamical model and compare it to the eye velocity responses measured in monkeys. The dynamical model repro duces the observed amplitude and time course of the modulation of the VOR and suggests one way to combine the required neural signals within the cerebellum and the brain stem. It also makes predictions for the responses of neurons to multiple inputs (head rotation and translation,",NLP,a34bacf839b923770b2c360eefa26748-Paper.pdf,1995
Constructive Algorithms for Hierarchical,"We present two additions to the hierarchical mixture of experts (HME) architecture.

A superior example is medical epidemiology where the goal is to find the causes of a disease and exclude factors which are irrelevant. Whereas complete independence between two variables in a domain might be rare in reality (which would mean that the joint probability density of variables A and B can be factored: = p(A, B) p(A)p(B)), conditional independence is more common and is often a result from true or apparent causality: consider the case that A is the cause of B = and B is the cause of C, then p(CIA, B) p",Bayesian networks for continuous variables using non linear conditional density estimators,a5e0ff62be0b08456fc7f1e88812af3d-Paper.pdf,1995

Stable Dynamic Parameter Adaptation,"A stability criterion for dynamic parameter adaptation is given. In the case of the learning rate of backpropagation, a class of stable algorithms is presented and studied, including a convergence proof. 1 INTRODUCTION All but a few learning algorithms employ one or more parameters that control the quality of learning. Backpropagation has its learning rate and momentum param eter; Boltzmann learning uses a simulated annealing schedule; Kohonen learning a learning rate and a decay parameter; genetic algorithms probabilities, etc. The investigator always has to set the parameters to specific values when trying to solve a certain problem.

Experiments with Neural Networks for Real,"This paper describes a neural network based controller for allocating capacity in a telecommunications network. This system was proposed in order to overcome a ""real time"" response constraint. Two basic architectures are evaluated: 1) a feedforward network-heuristic and; 2) a feedforward network-recurrent network. These architectures are compared against a linear programming (LP) optimiser as a benchmark. This LP optimiser was also used as a teacher to label the data samples for the feedforward neural network training algorithm. It is found that the systems are able to provide a traffic throughput of 99% and 95%, respectively, of the throughput obtained by the linear programming solution.

Cholinergic suppression of transmission may,"Selective suppression of transmission at feedback synapses during learning is proposed as a mechanism for combining associative feed back with self-organization of feed forward synapses. Experimental data demonstrates cholinergic suppression of synaptic transmission in layer I (feedback synapses), and a lack of suppression in layer IV (feed forward synapses). A network with this feature uses local rules to learn mappings which are not linearly separable. During learning, sensory stimuli and desired response are simultaneously presented as input. Feedforward connections form self-organized representations of input, while suppressed feedback connections learn the transpose of feedfor ward connectivity. During recall, suppression is removed, sensory input activates the self-organized representation, and activity generates the learned response. 1 INTRODUCTION The synaptic connections in most models of the cortex can be defined as either associative or self-organizing on the basis of a sing",Reinforcement Learning,af21d0c97db2e27e13572cbf59eb343d-Paper.pdf,1995
Dynamics of Attention as Near,"In consideration of attention as a means for goal-directed behav ior in non-stationary environments, we argue that the dynamics of attention should satisfy two opposing demands: long-term main tenance and quick transition. These two characteristics are con tradictory within the linear domain. We propose the near saddle node bifurcation behavior of a sigmoidal unit with self-connection as a candidate of dynamical mechanism that satisfies both of these demands. We further show in simulations of the 'bug-eat-food' tasks that the near saddle-node bifurcation behavior of recurrent networks can emerge as a functional property for survival in non stationary environments. 1 INTRODUCTION Most studies of attention have focused on the selection process of incoming sensory cues (Posner et al., 1980; Koch et al., 1985; Desimone et al., 1995).

We investigate analytically an example of this more general approach applied to the structure of interdigitated mappings, such as the pattern of ocular dominance columns in primary visual cortex. 1 INTRODUCTION A prevalent feature of mappings in the brain is that they are often ""topographic"".

Softassign versus Softmax: Benchmarks,"A new technique, termed soft assign, is applied for the first time to two classic combinatorial optimization problems, the travel ing salesman problem and graph partitioning. Soft assign , which has emerged from the recurrent neural network/statistical physics framework, enforces two-way (assignment) constraints without the use of penalty terms in the energy functions. The soft assign can also be generalized from two-way winner-take-all constraints to multiple membership constraints which are required for graph par titioning. The soft assign technique is compared to the softmax (Potts glass). Within the statistical physics framework, softmax and a penalty term has been a widely used method for enforcing the two-way constraints common within many combinatorial optimiza tion problems.

From Isolation to Cooperation:,"We introduce a constructive, incremental learning system for regression problems that models data by means of locally linear experts. In contrast to other approaches, the experts are trained independently and do not compete for data during learning. Only when a prediction for a query is required do the experts cooperate by blending their individual predic tions. Each expert is trained by minimizing a penalized local cross vali dation error using second order methods. In this way, an expert is able to find a local distance metric by adjusting the size and shape of the recep tive field in which its predictions are valid, and also to detect relevant in put features by adjusting its bias on the importance of individual input dimensions. We derive asymptotic results for our method. In a variety of simulations the properties of the algorithm are demonstrated with respect to interference, learning speed, prediction accuracy, feature detection, and task oriented incremental learning.",Optimization & Theoretical ML,b4d168b48157c623fbd095b4a565b5bb-Paper.pdf,1995

Often the parameters used in these net works need to be learned from examples. Unfortunately, estimat ing the parameters via exact probabilistic calculations (i.e, the EM-algorithm) is intractable even for networks with fairly small numbers of hidden units. We propose to avoid the infeasibility of the E step by bounding likelihoods instead of computing them ex actly. We introduce extended and complementary representations for these networks and show that the estimation of the network parameters can be made fast (reduced to quadratic optimization) by performing the estimation in either of the alternative domains.

The first corresponds to nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainties where the parameters occur nonlinearly. The second corresponds to systems for which stabilizing control struc tures cannot be determined. The proposed neural controllers are shown to result in closed-loop system stability under certain conditions. 1 INTRODUCTION The problem that we address here is the control of general nonlinear dynamic systems in the presence of uncertainties.

Such scenarios provide the opportunity to transfer knowledge across multiple learning tasks, in order to generalize more accurately from less training data. In this paper, several different approaches to lifelong learning are described, and applied in an object recognition domain. It is shown that across the board, lifelong learning approaches generalize consistently more accurately from less training data, by their ability to transfer knowledge across learning tasks. 1 Introduction Supervised learning is concerned with approximating an unknown function based on exam ples.

A Dynamical Systems Approach for a Learnable Autonomous Robot,"This paper discusses how a robot can learn goal-directed naviga tion tasks using local sensory inputs. The emphasis is that such learning tasks could be formulated as an embedding problem of dynamical systems: desired trajectories in a task space should be embedded into an adequate sensory-based internal state space so that an unique mapping from the internal state space to the motor command could be established. The paper shows that a recurrent neural network suffices in self-organizing such an adequate internal state space from the temporal sensory input. In our experiments, using a real robot with a laser range sensor, the robot navigated robustly by achieving dynamical coherence with the environment. It was also shown that such coherence becomes structurally sta ble as the global attractor is self-organized in the coupling of the internal and the environmental dynamics. 1 Introd uction Conventionally, robot navigation problems have been formulated assuming a global view of the worl",Reinforcement Learning,c3e0c62ee91db8dc7382bde7419bb573-Paper.pdf,1995
Optimization Principles for the Neural,"Recent experiments show that the neural codes at work in a wide range of creatures share some common features. At first sight, these observations seem unrelated. However, we show that these features arise naturally in a linear filtered threshold crossing (LFTC) model when we set the threshold to maximize the transmitted information. This maximization process requires neural adaptation to not only the DC signal level, as in conventional light and dark adaptation, but also to the statistical structure of the signal and noise distribu tions. We also present a new approach for calculating the mutual information between a neuron's output spike train and any aspect of its input signal which does not require reconstruction of the in put signal. This formulation is valid provided the correlations in the spike train are small, and we provide a procedure for checking this assumption. This paper is based on joint work (DeWeese [1], 1995). Preliminary results from the LFTC model appeared in a prev",Optimization & Theoretical ML,c6036a69be21cb660499b75718a3ef24-Paper.pdf,1995
A Framework for Non-rigid Matching,"Matching feature point sets lies at the core of many approaches to object recognition. We present a framework for non-rigid match ing that begins with a skeleton module, affine point matching, and then integrates multiple features to improve correspondence and develops an object representation based on spatial regions to model local transformations. The algorithm for feature matching iteratively updates the transformation parameters and the corre spondence solution, each in turn. The affine mapping is solved in closed form, which permits its use for data of any dimension. The correspondence is set via a method for two-way constraint satisfac tion, called softassign, which has recently emerged from the neural network/statistical physics realm. The complexity of the non-rigid matching algorithm with multiple features is the same as that of the affine point matching algorithm. Results for synthetic and real world data are provided for point sets in 2D and 3D, and for 2D data with multiple",Computer Vision,c60d060b946d6dd6145dcbad5c4ccf6f-Paper.pdf,1995
Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks for,"We have already shown that extracting long-term dependencies from se quential data is difficult, both for determimstic dynamical systems such as recurrent networks, and probabilistic models such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) or input/output hidden Markov models (IOHMMs). In practice, to avoid this problem, researchers have used domain specific a-priori knowledge to give meaning to the hidden or state variables rep resenting past context. In this paper, we propose to use a more general type of a-priori knowledge, namely that the temporal dependencIes are structured hierarchically. This implies that long-term dependencies are represented by variables with a long time scale. This principle is applied to a recurrent network which includes delays and multiple time scales. Ex periments confirm the advantages of such structures. A similar approach is proposed for HMMs and IOHMMs. 1 Introduction Learning from examples basically amounts to identifying the relations between random variables of ",NLP,c667d53acd899a97a85de0c201ba99be-Paper.pdf,1995
Finite State Automata that Recurrent,"This paper relates the computational power of Fahlman' s Recurrent Cascade Correlation (RCC) architecture to that of fInite state automata (FSA). While some recurrent networks are FSA equivalent, RCC is not. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the RCC architecture in the form of a proof describing a large class of FSA which cannot be realized by RCC. 1 INTRODUCTION Recurrent networks can be considered to be defmed by two components: a network architecture, and a learning rule. The former describes how a network with a given set of weights and topology computes its output values, while the latter describes how the weights (and possibly topology) of the network are updated to fIt a specifIc problem. It is possible to evaluate the computational power of a network architecture by analyzing the types of computations a network could perform assuming appropriate connection weights (and topology).

Memory-based Stochastic Optimization,"In this paper we introduce new algorithms for optimizing noisy plants in which each experiment is very expensive. The algorithms build a global non-linear model of the expected output at the same time as using Bayesian linear regression analysis of locally weighted polynomial models. The local model answers queries about confi dence, noise, gradient and Hessians, and use them to make auto mated decisions similar to those made by a practitioner of Response Surface Methodology. The global and local models are combined naturally as a locally weighted regression. We examine the ques tion of whether the global model can really help optimization, and we extend it to the case of time-varying functions. We compare the new algorithms with a highly tuned higher-order stochastic op timization algorithm on randomly-generated functions and a sim ulated manufacturing task. We note significant improvements in total regret, time to converge, and final solution quality. 1 INTRODUCTION In a stochastic o",Optimization & Theoretical ML,c7635bfd99248a2cdef8249ef7bfbef4-Paper.pdf,1995
Handwritten Word Recognition using Contextual,"A hybrid and contextual radial basis function networklhidden Markov model off-line handwritten word recognition system is presented. The task assigned to the radial basis function networks is the estimation of emission probabilities associated to Markov states. The model is contex tual because the estimation of emission probabilities takes into account the left context of the current image segment as represented by its pred ecessor in the sequence. The new system does not outperform the previ ous system without context but acts differently. 1 INTRODUCTION Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are now commonly used in off-line recognition of handwritten words (Chen et aI., 1994) (Gilloux et aI., 1993) (Gilloux et al. 1995a). In some of these approaches (Gilloux et al. 1993), word images are transformed into sequences of image segments through some explicit segmentation procedure.

Universal Approximation and Learning,"Natural and artificial neural circuits must be capable of travers ing specific state space trajectories. A natural approach to this problem is to learn the relevant trajectories from examples. Un fortunately, gradient descent learning of complex trajectories in amorphous networks is unsuccessful. We suggest a possible ap proach where trajectories are realized by combining simple oscil lators, in various modular ways. We contrast two regimes of fast and slow oscillations. In all cases, we show that banks of oscillators with bounded frequencies have universal approximation properties. Open questions are also discussed briefly. 1 INTRODUCTION: TRAJECTORY LEARNING The design of artificial neural systems, in robotics applications and others, often leads to the problem of constructing a recurrent neural network capable of producing a particular trajectory, in the state space of its visible units.

Correlated Neuronal Response:,"We have analyzed the relationship between correlated spike count and the peak in the cross-correlation of spike trains for pairs of si multaneously recorded neurons from a previous study of area MT in the macaque monkey (Zohary et al., 1994). We conclude that common input, responsible for creating peaks on the order of ten milliseconds wide in the spike train cross-correlograms (CCGs), is also responsible for creating the correlation in spike count ob served at the two second time scale of the trial. We argue that both common excitation and inhibition may play significant roles in establishing this correlation. 1 INTRODUCTION In a previous study of pairs of MT neurons recorded using a single extracellular electrode, it was found that the spike count during two seconds of visual motion stimulation had an average correlation coefficient of r = 0.12 and that this cor relation could significantly limit the usefulness of pooling across increasingly large populations of neurons (Zohary et aI",NLP,ce5140df15d046a66883807d18d0264b-Paper.pdf,1995
Worst-case Loss Bounds,"We analyze and compare the well-known Gradient Descent algo rithm and a new algorithm, called the Exponentiated Gradient algorithm, for training a single neuron with an arbitrary transfer function. Both algorithms are easily generalized to larger neural networks, and the generalization of Gradient Descent is the stan dard back-propagation algorithm. In this paper we prove worst case loss bounds for both algorithms in the single neuron case. Since local minima make it difficult to prove worst-case bounds for gradient-based algorithms, we must use a loss function that prevents the formation of spurious local minima. We define such a matching loss function for any strictly increasing differentiable transfer function and prove worst-case loss bound for any such transfer function and its corresponding matching loss. For exam ple, the matching loss for the identity function is the square loss and the matching loss for the logistic sigmoid is the entropic loss.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach a hedged portfolio which consists of equally capitalized long and short positions is constructed and its historical returns are benchmarked against T-bill returns and the S&P500 index. 1 Introduction Traditional investment approaches (Elton and Gruber, 1991) assume that the return of a security can be described by a multifactor linear model: (1) where Hi denotes the return on security i, Fl are a set of factor values and Uil are security i exposure to factor I, ai is an intercept term (which under the CAPM framework is assumed to be equal to the risk free rate of return (Sharpe, 1984)) and ei is a random term with mean zero which is assumed to be uncorrelated across securities.

The Geometry of Eye Rotations,"We analyse the geometry of eye rotations, and in particular saccades, using basic Lie group theory and differential geome try. Various parameterizations of rotations are related through a unifying mathematical treatment, and transformations between co-ordinate systems are computed using the Campbell-Baker Hausdorff formula. Next, we describe Listing's law by means of the Lie algebra so(3). This enables us to demonstrate a direct connection to Donders' law, by showing that eye orientations are restricted to the quotient space 80(3)/80(2). The latter is equiv alent to the sphere S2, which is exactly the space of gaze directions. Our analysis provides a mathematical framework for studying the oculomotor system and could also be extended to investigate the geometry of mUlti-joint arm movements. 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 SACCADES AND LISTING'S LAW Saccades are fast eye movements, bringing objects of interest into the center of the visual field.

Examples of learning curves from a modified,"We examine the issue of evaluation of model specific parameters in a modified VC-formalism. Two examples are analyzed: the 2-dimensional homogeneous perceptron and the I-dimensional higher order neuron. Both models are solved theoretically, and their learning curves are com pared against true learning curves. It is shown that the formalism has the potential to generate a variety of learning curves, including ones displaying ''phase transitions."" 1 Introduction One of the main criticisms of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory of learning [15] is that the results of the theory appear very loose when compared with empirical data. In contrast, theory based on statistical physics ideas [1] provides tighter numerical results as well as qualitatively distinct predictions (such as ""phase transitions"" to perfect generalization). (See [5, 14] for a fuller discussion.) A question arises as to whether the VC-theory can be modified to give these improvements.

Using Unlabeled Data for Supervised,"Many classification problems have the property that the only costly part of obtaining examples is the class label. This paper suggests a simple method for using distribution information contained in unlabeled examples to augment labeled examples in a supervised training framework. Empirical tests show that the technique de scribed in this paper can significantly improve the accuracy of a supervised learner when the learner is well below its asymptotic accuracy level. 1 INTRODUCTION Supervised learning problems often have the following property: unlabeled examples have little or no cost while class labels have a high cost. For example, it is trivial to record hours of heartbeats from hundreds of patients. However, it is expensive to hire cardiologists to label each of the recorded beats. One response to the expense of class labels is to squeeze the most information possible out of each labeled example. Regularization and cross-validation both have this goal.

Implementation Issues in the Fourier,"The Fourier transform of boolean functions has come to play an important role in proving many important learnability results.

We describe the more prominent changes we have introduced to the algorithm, ones that were crucial and without which the performance of the algorithm would severely deterio rate. One of the benefits we present is the confidence level for each prediction which measures the likelihood the prediction is correct. 1 INTRODUCTION Over the last few years the Fourier Transform (FT) representation of boolean func tions has been an instrumental tool in the computational learning theory commu nity.

In this paper, we approach automated facial expression analysis by detecting and classifying facial actions. We generated a database of over 1100 image sequences of 24 subjects performing over 150 distinct facial actions or action combinations. We compare three different ap proaches to classifying the facial actions in these images: Holistic spatial analysis based on principal components of graylevel images; explicit measurement of local image features such as wrinkles; and template matching with motion flow fields.

A New Learning Algorithm for Blind,"A new on-line learning algorithm which minimizes a statistical de pendency among outputs is derived for blind separation of mixed signals. The dependency is measured by the average mutual in formation (MI) of the outputs. The source signals and the mixing matrix are unknown except for the number of the sources. The Gram-Charlier expansion instead of the Edgeworth expansion is used in evaluating the MI. The natural gradient approach is used to minimize the MI. A novel activation function is proposed for the on-line learning algorithm which has an equivariant property and is easily implemented on a neural network like model. The validity of the new learning algorithm are verified by computer simulations. 1 INTRODUCTION The problem of blind signal separation arises in many areas such as speech recog nition, data communication, sensor signal processing, and medical science.

Gradient and Hamiltonian Dynamics,"The process of machine learning can be considered in two stages: model selection and parameter estimation. In this paper a technique is presented for constructing dynamical systems with desired qualitative properties. The approach is based on the fact that an n-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system can be decomposed into one gradient and (n - 1) Hamiltonian sys tems. Thus, the model selection stage consists of choosing the gradient and Hamiltonian portions appropriately so that a certain behavior is obtainable. To estimate the parameters, a stably convergent learning rule is presented. This algorithm has been proven to converge to the desired system trajectory for all initial conditions and system inputs. This technique can be used to design neural network models which are guaranteed to solve the trajectory learning problem. 1 Introduction A fundamental problem in mathematical systems theory is the identification of dy namical systems.

Human Reading and the Curse of,"Whereas optical character recognition (OCR) systems learn to clas sify single characters; people learn to classify long character strings in parallel, within a single fixation. This difference is surprising because high dimensionality is associated with poor classification learning. This paper suggests that the human reading system avoids these problems because the number of to-be-classified im ages is reduced by consistent and optimal eye fixation positions, and by character sequence regularities. An interesting difference exists between human reading and optical character recog nition (OCR) systems. The input/output dimensionality of character classification in human reading is much greater than that for OCR systems (see Figure 1).

Unsupervised Pixel-prediction,"When a sensory system constructs a model of the environment from its input, it might need to verify the model's accuracy. One method of verification is multivariate time-series prediction: a good model could predict the near-future activity of its inputs, much as a good scientific theory predicts future data. Such a predict ing model would require copious top-down connections to compare the predictions with the input. That feedback could improve the model's performance in two ways: by biasing internal activity to ward expected patterns, and by generating specific error signals if the predictions fail. A proof-of-concept model-an event-driven, computationally efficient layered network, incorporating ""cortical"" features like all-excitatory synapses and local inhibition- was con structed to make near-future predictions of a simple, moving stim ulus.

Control of Selective Visual Attention:,"Intermediate and higher vision processes require selection of a sub set of the available sensory information before further processing. Usually, this selection is implemented in the form of a spatially circumscribed region of the visual field, the so-called ""focus of at tention"" which scans the visual scene dependent on the input and on the attentional state of the subject.

Investment Learning,"We propose a hierarchical scheme for rapid learning of context dependent ""skills"" that is based on the recently introduced ""Parameterized Self Organizing Map"" (""PSOM"").

The specialization is carried out by a prior ""investment learning stage"", during which the system acquires a set of basis mappings or ""skills"" for a set of prototypical contexts. Adaptation of a ""skill"" to a new context can then be achieved by interpolating in the space of the basis mappings and thus can be extremely rapid.

Stable Fitted Reinforcement Learning,"We describe the reinforcement learning problem, motivate algo rithms which seek an approximation to the Q function, and present new convergence results for two such algorithms. 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Imagine an agent acting in some environment. At time t, the environment is in some state Xt chosen from a finite set of states. The agent perceives Xt, and is allowed to choose an action at from some finite set of actions. The environment then changes state, so that at time (t + 1) it is in a new state Xt+1 chosen from a probability distribution which depends only on Xt and at. Meanwhile, the agent experiences a real-valued cost Ct, chosen from a distribution which also depends only on Xt and at and which has finite mean and variance. Such an environment is called a Markov decision process, or MDP.

Information through a Spiking Neuron,"While it is generally agreed that neurons transmit information about their synaptic inputs through spike trains, the code by which this information is transmitted is not well understood. An upper bound on the information encoded is obtained by hypothesizing that the precise timing of each spike conveys information.

We formu late the problem in terms of the probability distribution peT) of interspike intervals (ISIs), assuming that spikes are detected with arbitrary but finite temporal resolution. In the absence of added noise, all the variability in the ISIs could encode information, and the information rate is simply the entropy of the lSI distribution, H (T) = (-p(T) log2 p(T)}, times the spike rate.

A Predictive Switching Model of,"We present a hypothesis about how the cerebellum could partici pate in regulating movement in the presence of significant feedback delays without resorting to a forward model of the motor plant. We show how a simplified cerebellar model can learn to control end point positioning of a nonlinear spring-mass system with realistic delays in both afferent and efferent pathways. The model's opera tion involves prediction, but instead of predicting sensory input, it directly regulates movement by reacting in an anticipatory fashion to input patterns that include delayed sensory feedback. 1 INTRODUCTION The existence of significant delays in sensorimotor feedback pathways has led several researchers to suggest that the cerebellum might function as a forward model of the motor plant in order to predict the sensory consequences of motor commands before actual feedback is available; e.g., (Ito, 1984; Keeler, 1990; Miall et ai., 1993). While we agree that there are many potential roles for forward",Reinforcement Learning,feab05aa91085b7a8012516bc3533958-Paper.pdf,1995
Recurrent Neural Networks for Missing or,"In this paper we propose recurrent neural networks with feedback into the input units for handling two types of data analysis problems. On the one hand, this scheme can be used for static data when some of the input variables are missing. On the other hand, it can also be used for sequential data, when some of the input variables are missing or are available at different frequencies. Unlike in the case of probabilistic models (e.g. Gaussian) of the missing variables, the network does not attempt to model the distribution of the missmg variables given the observed variables. Instead it is a more ""discriminant"" approach that fills in the missing variables for the sole purpose of minimizing a learning criterion (e.g., to minimize an output error). 1 Introduction Learning from examples implies discovering certain relations between variables of interest. The most general form of learning requires to essentially capture the joint distribution between these variables. However, for many specif",NLP,ffeed84c7cb1ae7bf4ec4bd78275bb98-Paper.pdf,1995
Hebb Learning of Features,"This paper investigates the stationary points of a Hebb learning rule with a sigmoid nonlinearity in it. We show mathematically that when the input has a low information content, as measured by the input's variance, this learning rule suppresses learning, that is, forces the weight vector to converge to the zero vector. When the information content exceeds a certain value, the rule will automatically begin to learn a feature in the input. Our analysis suggests that under certain conditions it is the first principal component that is learned. The weight vector length remains bounded, provided the variance of the input is finite. Simulations confirm the theoretical results derived. 1 Introduction Hebb learning, one of the main mechanisms of synaptic strengthening, is induced by cooccurrent activity of pre- and post-synaptic neurons. It is used in artificial neural networks like perceptrons, associative memories, and unsupervised learning neural networks.

A variational principle for,"Given a multidimensional data set and a model of its density, we consider how to define the optimal interpolation between two points. This is done by assigning a cost to each path through space, based on two competing goals-one to interpolate through regions of high density, the other to minimize arc length. From this path functional, we derive the Euler-Lagrange equations for extremal motionj given two points, the desired interpolation is found by solv ing a boundary value problem. We show that this interpolation can be done efficiently, in high dimensions, for Gaussian, Dirichlet, and mixture models. 1 Introduction The problem of non-linear interpolation arises frequently in image, speech, and signal processing.

ARTEX: A Self-Organizing Architecture,"A self-organizing architecture is developed for image region classi fication. The system consists of a preprocessor that utilizes multi scale filtering, competition, cooperation, and diffusion to compute a vector of image boundary and surface properties, notably texture and brightness properties. This vector inputs to a system that incrementally learns noisy multidimensional mappings and their probabilities. The architecture is applied to difficult real-world image classification problems, including classification of synthet ic aperture radar and natural texture images, and outperforms a recent state-of-the-art system at classifying natural textures. 1 INTRODUCTION Automatic processing of visual scenes often begins by detecting regions of an image with common values of simple local features, such as texture, and mapping the pat tern offeature activation into a predicted region label.

The algorithm -,"The power of sampling methods in Bayesian reconstruction of noisy signals is well known. The extension of sampling to temporal prob lems is discussed. Efficacy of sampling over time is demonstrated with visual tracking. 1 INTRODUCTION The problem of tracking curves in dense visual clutter is a challenging one. Trackers based on Kalman filters are of limited power; because they are based on Gaussian densities which are unimodal they cannot represent simultaneous alternative hy potheses. Extensions to the Kalman filter to handle multiple data associations (Bar-Shalom and Fortmann, 1988) work satisfactorily in the simple case of point targets but do not extend naturally to continuous curves. Tracking is the propagation of shape and motion estimates over time, driven by a temporal stream of observations. The noisy observations that arise in realistic problems demand a robust approach involving propagation of probability distribu tions over time.

Relying only on gra dient flow information it can be applied to learning continuous functions or distributions, even when no explicit loss function is gi ven and the Hessian is not available. Its efficiency is demonstrated for a non-stationary blind separation task of acoustic signals. 1 Introduction Neural networks provide powerful tools to capture the structure in data by learning. Often the batch learning paradigm is assumed, where the learner is given all trai ning examples simultaneously and allowed to use them as often as desired. In large practical applications batch learning is often experienced to be rather infeasible and instead on-line learning is employed. In the on-line learning scenario only one example is given at a time and then discar ded after learning. So it is less memory consuming and at the same time it fits well into more natural learning, where the lear",Optimization & Theoretical ML,0e095e054ee94774d6a496099eb1cf6a-Paper.pdf,1996

I describe experiments with locally-weighted regression on two simple prob lems, and observe that this ""bias-only"" approach outperforms the more common ""variance-only"" exploration approach, even in the presence of noise. 1 INTRODUCTION In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in ""active"" machine learning systems. These are learning systems that make queries, or perform experiments to gather data that are expected to maximize performance. When compared with ""passive"" learning systems, which accept given, or randomly drawn data, active learners have demonstrated significant decreases in the amount of data required to achieve equivalent performance. In industrial applications, where each experiment may take days to perform and cost thousands of dollars, a method for optimally selecting these points would offer enormous savings in time and money.

Dual Kalman Filtering Methods for,"Prediction, estimation, and smoothing are fundamental to signal processing. To perform these interrelated tasks given noisy data, we form a time series model of the process that generates the data. Taking noise in the system explicitly into account, maximum likelihood and Kalman frameworks are discussed which involve the dual process of estimating both the model parameters and the un derlying state of the system. We review several established meth ods in the linear case, and propose severa! extensions utilizing dual Kalman filters (DKF) and forward-backward (FB) filters that are applicable to neural networks. Methods are compared on several simulations of noisy time series. We also include an example of nonlinear noise reduction in speech. 1 INTRODUCTION Consider the general autoregressive model of a noisy time series with both process and additive observation noise: x(k) I(x(k - 1), ... x(k - M), w) + v(k - 1) (1) y(k) x(k) + r(k), (2) where x(k) corresponds to the true underlying tim",Optimization & Theoretical ML,147702db07145348245dc5a2f2fe5683-Paper.pdf,1996
Source Separation and Density,"We couple the tasks of source separation and density estimation by extracting the local geometrical structure of distributions ob tained from mixtures of statistically independent sources. Our modifications of the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm results in purely digital learning rules which perform non-parametric his togram density estimation. The non-parametric nature of the sep aration allows for source separation of non-linear mixtures. An anisotropic coupling is introduced into our SOM with the role of aligning the network locally with the independent component con tours. This approach provides an exact verification condition for source separation with no prior on the source distributions. 1 INTRODUCTION Much of the current work on visual cortex modeling has focused on the generation of coding which captures statistical independence and sparseness (Bell and Sejnowski 1996, Olshausen and Field 1996).

Continuous sigmoidal belief networks,"Real-valued random hidden variables can be useful for modelling latent structure that explains correlations among observed vari ables. I propose a simple unit that adds zero-mean Gaussian noise to its input before passing it through a sigmoidal squashing func tion. Such units can produce a variety of useful behaviors, ranging from deterministic to binary stochastic to continuous stochastic. I show how ""slice sampling"" can be used for inference and learning in top-down networks of these units and demonstrate learning on two simple problems. 1 Introduction A variety of unsupervised connectionist models containing discrete-valued hidden units have been developed. These include Boltzmann machines (Hinton and Se jnowski 1986), binary sigmoidal belief networks (Neal 1992) and Helmholtz ma chines (Hinton et al. 1995; Dayan et al. 1995).

"Compositionality, MDL Priors, and","Images are ambiguous at each of many levels of a contextual hi erarchy. Nevertheless, the high-level interpretation of most scenes is unambiguous, as evidenced by the superior performance of hu mans. This observation argues for global vision models, such as de formable templates. Unfortunately, such models are computation ally intractable for unconstrained problems. We propose a composi tional model in which primitives are recursively composed, subject to syntactic restrictions, to form tree-structured objects and object groupings. Ambiguity is propagated up the hierarchy in the form of multiple interpretations, which are later resolved by a Bayesian, equivalently minimum-description-Iength, cost functional. 1 Bayesian decision theory and compositionaiity In his Essay on Probability, Laplace (1812) devotes a short chapter-his ""Sixth Principle"" -to what we call today the Bayesian decision rule.

A mean field algorithm for Bayes learning,"We present an algorithm which is expected to realise Bayes optimal predictions in large feed-forward networks. It is based on mean field methods developed within statistical mechanics of disordered sys tems. We give a derivation for the single layer perceptron and show that the algorithm also provides a leave-one-out cross-validation test of the predictions. Simulations show excellent agreement with theoretical results of statistical mechanics. 1 INTRODUCTION Bayes methods have become popular as a consistent framework for regularization and model selection in the field of neural networks (see e.g. [MacKay,1992]). In the Bayes approach to statistical inference [Berger, 1985] one assumes that the prior uncertainty about parameters of an unknown data generating mechanism can be encoded in a probability distribution, the so called prior. Using the prior and the likelihood of the data given the parameters, the posterior distribution of the parameters can be derived from Bayes rule.

Ordered Classes and Incomplete Examples,"The classes in classification tasks often have a natural ordering, and the training and testing examples are often incomplete. We propose a non linear ordinal model for classification into ordered classes. Predictive, simulation-based approaches are used to learn from past and classify fu ture incomplete examples. These techniques are illustrated by making prognoses for patients who have suffered severe head injuries. 1 Motivation Jennett et al. (1979) reported data on patients with severe head injuries. For each patient some of the information in Table 1 was available shortly after injury. The objective is to predict the degree of recovery attained within six months as measured by outcome. This problem exhibits two characteristics that are common in classification tasks: allocation qf examples into classes which have a natural ordering, and learning from past and classifying future incomplete examples. 2 A Flexible Model for Ordered Classes The Bayes decision rule (see, for example, R",Optimization & Theoretical ML,1c65cef3dfd1e00c0b03923a1c591db4-Paper.pdf,1996
Unification of Information Maximization,"In the present paper, we propose a method to unify information maximization and minimization in hidden units. The information maximization and minimization are performed on two different lev els: collective and individual level. Thus, two kinds of information: collective and individual information are defined. By maximizing collective information and by minimizing individual information, simple networks can be generated in terms of the number of con nections and the number of hidden units. Obtained networks are expected to give better generalization and improved interpretation of internal representations. This method was applied to the infer ence of the maximum onset principle of an artificial language. In this problem, it was shown that the individual information min imization is not contradictory to the collective information max imization. In addition, experimental results confirmed improved generalization performance, because over-training can significantly be suppressed. 1 Introdu",Optimization & Theoretical ML,1cecc7a77928ca8133fa24680a88d2f9-Paper.pdf,1996
Multi-Task Learning for Stock Selection,"Artificial Neural Networks can be used to predict future returns of stocks in order to take financial decisions. Should one build a separate network for each stock or share the same network for all the stocks? In this paper we also explore other alternatives, in which some layers are shared and others are not shared. When the prediction of future returns for different stocks are viewed as different tasks, sharing some parameters across stocks is a form of multi-task learning. In a series of experiments with Canadian stocks, we obtain yearly returns that are more than 14% above various benchmarks. 1 Introd uction Previous applications of ANNs to financial time-series suggest that several of these prediction and decision-taking tasks present sufficient non-linearities to justify the use of ANNs (Refenes, 1994; Moody, Levin and Rehfuss, 1993).

Cholinergic Modulation Preserves Spike,"Neuromodulation can change not only the mean firing rate of a neuron, but also its pattern of firing. Therefore, a reliable neu ral coding scheme, whether a rate coding or a spike time based coding, must be robust in a dynamic neuromodulatory environ ment. The common observation that cholinergic modulation leads to a reduction in spike frequency adaptation implies a modifica tion of spike timing, which would make a neural code based on precise spike timing difficult to maintain. In this paper, the effects of cholinergic modulation were studied to test the hypothesis that precise spike timing can serve as a reliable neural code. Using the whole cell patch-clamp technique in rat neocortical slice prepara tion and compartmental modeling techniques, we show that cholin ergic modulation, surprisingly, preserved spike timing in response to a fluctuating inputs that resembles in vivo conditions.

We illustrate classes of learning curve behavior in various chains, and show the manner in which TD is sensitive to the choice of its step size and eligibility trace parameters. 1 INTRODUCTION A reassuring theory of asymptotic convergence is available for many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. What is not available, however, is a theory that explains the finite-term learning curve behavior of RL algorithms, e.g., what are the different kinds of learning curves, what are their key determinants, and how do different problem parameters effect rate of convergence.

Dynamics of Training,"A new method to calculate the full training process of a neural net work is introduced. No sophisticated methods like the replica trick are used. The results are directly related to the actual number of training steps. Some results are presented here, like the maximal learning rate, an exact description of early stopping, and the neces sary number of training steps. Further problems can be addressed with this approach. 1 INTRODUCTION Training guided by empirical risk minimization does not always minimize the ex pected risk. This phenomenon is called overfitting and is one of the major problems in neural network learning. In a previous work [Bos 1995] we developed an approx imate description of the training process using statistical mechanics.

A Constructive RBF Network,"This paper discusses a fairly general adaptation algorithm which augments a standard neural network to increase its recognition ac curacy for a specific user. The basis for the algorithm is that the output of a neural network is characteristic of the input, even when the output is incorrect. We exploit this characteristic output by using an Output Adaptation Module (OAM) which maps this out put into the correct user-dependent confidence vector. The OAM is a simplified Resource Allocating Network which constructs ra dial basis functions on-line. We applied the OAM to construct a writer-adaptive character recognition system for on-line hand printed characters. The OAM decreases the word error rate on a test set by an average of 45%, while creating only 3 to 25 basis functions for each writer in the test set. 1 Introduction One of the major difficulties in creating any statistical pattern recognition system is that the statistics of the training set is often different from the statistics ",Deep Learning,26588e932c7ccfa1df309280702fe1b5-Paper.pdf,1996
A Model of View-Tuned Neurons,"In 1990 Poggio and Edelman proposed a view-based model of ob ject recognition that accounts for several psychophysical properties of certain recognition tasks. The model predicted the existence of view-tuned and view-invariant units, that were later found by Lo gothetis et al. (Logothetis et al., 1995) in IT cortex of monkeys trained with views of specific paperclip objects. The model, how ever, does not specify the inputs to the view-tuned units and their internal organization. In this paper we propose a model of these view-tuned units that is consistent with physiological data from single cell responses. 1 INTRODUCTION Recognition of specific objects, such as recognition of a particular face, can be based on representations that are object centered, such as 3D structural models. Alternatively, a 3D object may be represented for the purpose of recognition in terms of a set of views.

MLP can provably generalise much better,"Results of a study of the worst case learning curves for a partic ular class of probability distribution on input space to MLP with hard threshold hidden units are presented. It is shown in partic ular, that in the thermodynamic limit for scaling by the number of connections to the first hidden layer, although the true learning curve behaves as ~ a-I for a ~ 1, its VC-dimension based bound is trivial (= 1) and its VC-entropy bound is trivial for a ::; 6.2. It is also shown that bounds following the true learning curve can be derived from a formalism based on the density of error patterns. 1 Introduction The VC-formalism and its extensions link the generalisation capabilities of a binary valued neural network with its counting functionl , e.g. via upper bounds implied by VC-dimension or VC-entropy on this function [17, 18].

Early Brain Damage,"Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) is a method for reducing the num ber of weights in a neural network. OBD estimates the increase in cost function if weights are pruned and is a valid approximation if the learning algorithm has converged into a local minimum. On the other hand it is often desirable to terminate the learning pro cess before a local minimum is reached (early stopping). In this paper we show that OBD estimates the increase in cost function incorrectly if the network is not in a local minimum. We also show how OBD can be extended such that it can be used in connec tion with early stopping. We call this new approach Early Brain Damage, EBD. EBD also allows to revive already pruned weights.

Multidimensional Triangulation and,"Dynamic Programming, Q-Iearning and other discrete Markov Decision Process solvers can be -applied to continuous d-dimensional state-spaces by quantizing the state space into an array of boxes. This is often problematic above two dimensions: a coarse quantization can lead to poor policies, and fine quantization is too expensive. Possible solutions are variable-resolution discretization, or function approximation by neural nets. A third option, which has been little studied in the reinforcement learning literature, is interpolation on a coarse grid. In this paper we study interpolation tech niques that can result in vast improvements in the online behavior of the resulting control systems: multilinear interpolation, and an interpolation algorithm based on an interesting regular triangulation of d-dimensional space. We adapt these interpolators under three reinforcement learning paradigms: (i) offline value iteration with a known model, (ii) Q-Iearning, and (iii) online value iteration w",Reinforcement Learning,310ce61c90f3a46e340ee8257bc70e93-Paper.pdf,1996
Viewpoint invariant face recognition using,"We have explored two approaches to recogmzmg faces across changes in pose. First, we developed a representation of face images based on independent component analysis (ICA) and compared it to a principal component analysis (PCA) representation for face recognition. The ICA basis vectors for this data set were more spatially local than the PCA basis vectors and the ICA representa tion had greater invariance to changes in pose. Second, we present a model for the development of viewpoint invariant responses to faces from visual experience in a biological system. The temporal continuity of natural visual experience was incorporated into an attractor network model by Hebbian learning following a lowpass temporal filter on unit activities. When combined with the tem poral filter, a basic Hebbian update rule became a generalization of Griniasty et al. (1993), which associates temporally proximal input patterns into basins of attraction. The system acquired rep resentations of faces that were ",Computer Vision,3210ddbeaa16948a702b6049b8d9a202-Paper.pdf,1996
On the Effect of Analog Noise in,"We introduce a model for noise-robust analog computations with discrete time that is flexible enough to cover the most important concrete cases, such as computations in noisy analog neural nets and networks of noisy spiking neurons. We show that the presence of arbitrarily small amounts of analog noise reduces the power of analog computational models to that of finite automata, and we also prove a new type of upper bound for the VC-dimension of computational models with analog noise. 1 Introduction Analog noise is a serious issue in practical analog computation. However there exists no formal model for reliable computations by noisy analog systems which allows us to address this issue in an adequate manner. The investigation of noise-tolerant digital computations in the presence of stochastic failures of gates or wires had been initiated by [von Neumann, 1956]. We refer to [Cowan, 1966] and [Pippenger, 1989] for a small sample of the nllmerous results that have been achieved in this di",Optimization & Theoretical ML,33ceb07bf4eeb3da587e268d663aba1a-Paper.pdf,1996
Combined Weak Classifiers,"To obtain classification systems with both good generalization per formance and efficiency in space and time, we propose a learning method based on combinations of weak classifiers, where weak clas sifiers are linear classifiers (perceptrons) which can do a little better than making random guesses. A randomized algorithm is proposed to find the weak classifiers. TheyÂ· are then combined through a ma jority vote. As demonstrated through systematic experiments, the method developed is able to obtain combinations of weak classifiers with good generalization performance and a fast training time on a variety of test problems and real applications. 1 Introduction The problem we will investigate in this work is how to develop a classifier with both good generalization performance and efficiency in space and time in a supervised learning environment. The generalization performance is measured by the proba bility of classification error of a classifier. A classifier is said to be efficient if it",Machine Learning,3546ab441e56fa333f8b44b610d95691-Paper.pdf,1996
Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic,"In cellular telephone systems, an important problem is to dynami cally allocate the communication resource (channels) so as to max imize service in a stochastic caller environment. This problem is naturally formulated as a dynamic programming problem and we use a reinforcement learning (RL) method to find dynamic channel allocation policies that are better than previous heuristic solutions. The policies obtained perform well for a broad variety of call traf fic patterns. We present results on a large cellular system with approximately 4949 states. In cellular communication systems, an important problem is to allocate the com munication resource (bandwidth) so as to maximize the service provided to a set of mobile callers whose demand for service changes stochastically. A given geograph ical area is divided into mutually disjoint cells, and each cell serves the calls that are within its boundaries (see Figure 1a). The total system bandwidth is divided into channels, with each channel ce",Reinforcement Learning,3948ead63a9f2944218de038d8934305-Paper.pdf,1996
Neural Learning in Structured,"The parameter space of neural networks has a Riemannian met ric structure. The natural Riemannian gradient should be used instead of the conventional gradient, since the former denotes the true steepest descent direction of a loss function in the Riemannian space. The behavior of the stochastic gradient learning algorithm is much more effective if the natural gradient is used. The present paper studies the information-geometrical structure of perceptrons and other networks, and prove that the on-line learning method based on the natural gradient is asymptotically as efficient as the optimal batch algorithm. Adaptive modification of the learning constant is proposed and analyzed in terms of the Riemannian mea sure and is shown to be efficient. The natural gradient is finally applied to blind separation of mixtured independent signal sources. 1 Introd uction Neural learning takes place in the parameter space of modifiable synaptic weights of a neural network.

Extraction of temporal features in the,"The encoding of random time-varying stimuli in single spike trains of electrosensory neurons in the weakly electric fish Eigenmannia was investigated using methods of statistical signal processing. At the first stage of the electrosensory system, spike trains were found to encode faithfully the detailed time-course of random stimuli, while at the second stage neurons responded specifically to features in the temporal waveform of the stimulus. Therefore stimulus infor mation is processed at the second stage of the electrosensory system by extracting temporal features from the faithfully preserved image of the environment sampled at the first stage. 1 INTRODUCTION The weakly electric fish, Eigenmannia, generates a quasi sinusoidal, dipole-like elec tric field at individually fixed frequencies (250 - 600 Hz) by discharging an electric organ located in its tail (see Bullock and Heilgenberg, 1986 for reviews).

A Model of Recurrent Interactions in,"A general feature of the cerebral cortex is its massive intercon nectivity - it has been estimated anatomically [19] that cortical neurons receive upwards of 5,000 synapses, the majority of which originate from other nearby cortical neurons. Numerous experi ments in primary visual cortex (VI) have revealed strongly nonlin ear interactions between stimulus elements which activate classical and non-classical receptive field regions. Recurrent cortical con nections likely contribute substantially to these effects. However, most theories of visual processing have either assumed a feedfor ward processing scheme [7], or have used recurrent interactions to account for isolated effects only [1, 16, 18]. Since nonlinear sys tems cannot in general be taken apart and analyzed in pieces, it is not clear what one learns by building a recurrent model that only accounts for one, or very few phenomena. Here we develop a relatively simple model of recurrent interactions in VI, that re flects major anat",Deep Learning,3bf55bbad370a8fcad1d09b005e278c2-Paper.pdf,1996
On a Modification to the Mean Field EM,"A modification is described to the use of mean field approxima tions in the E step of EM algorithms for analysing data from latent structure models, as described by Ghahramani (1995), among oth ers. The modification involves second-order Taylor approximations to expectations computed in the E step. The potential benefits of the method are illustrated using very simple latent profile models. 1 Introduction Ghahramani (1995) advocated the use of mean field methods as a means to avoid the heavy computation involved in the E step of the EM algorithm used for estimating parameters within a certain latent structure model, and Ghahramani & Jordan (1995) used the same ideas in a more complex situation. Dunmur & Titterington (1996a) identified Ghahramani's model as a so-called latent profile model, they observed that Zhang (1992,1993) had used mean field methods for a similar purpose, and they showed, in a simulation study based on very simple examples, that the mean field version of the EM alg",Optimization & Theoretical ML,3f67fd97162d20e6fe27748b5b372509-Paper.pdf,1996
VLSI Implementation of Cortical Visual Motion,"Two dimensional image motion detection neural networks have been implemented using a general purpose analog neural computer. The neural circuits perform spatiotemporal feature extraction based on the cortical motion detection model of Adelson and Bergen. The neural computer provides the neurons, synapses and synaptic time-constants required to realize the model in VLSI hardware. Results show that visual motion estimation can be implemented with simple sum-and threshold neural hardware with temporal computational capabilities. The neural circuits compute general 20 visual motion in real-time. 1 INTRODUCTION Visual motion estimation is an area where spatiotemporal computation is of fundamental importance. Each distinct motion vector traces a unique locus in the space-time domain. Hence, the problem of visual motion estimation reduces to a feature extraction task, with each feature extractor tuned to a particular motion vector.

Local Bandit Approximation,"In general, procedures for determining Bayes-optimal adaptive controls for Markov decision processes (MDP's) require a pro hibitive amount of computation-the optimal learning problem is intractable. This paper proposes an approximate approach in which bandit processes are used to model, in a certain ""local"" sense, a given MDP. Bandit processes constitute an important subclass of MDP's, and have optimal learning strategies (defined in terms of Gittins indices) that can be computed relatively efficiently. Thus, one scheme for achieving approximately-optimal learning for gen eral MDP's proceeds by taking actions suggested by strategies that are optimal with respect to local bandit models. 1 INTRODUCTION Watkins [1989] has defined optimal learning as:"" the process of collecting and using information during learning in an optimal manner, so that the learner makes the best possible decisions at all stages of learning: learning itself is regarded as a mUltistage decision process, and learning",Optimization & Theoretical ML,4122cb13c7a474c1976c9706ae36521d-Paper.pdf,1996

The image is decomposed into local regions which are described by a new texture representation called ""Generalized Second Mo ments"" that are derived from the output of multiscale, multiorientation filter banks. Class-characteristic local texture features and their global composition is learned by a hierarchical mixture of experts architecture (Jordan & Jacobs). The technique is applied to a vehicle database consisting of 5 general car categories (Sedan, Van with back-doors, Van without back-doors, old Sedan, and Volkswagen Bug). This is a difficult problem with considerable in-class variation. The new technique has a 6.5% misclassification rate, compared to eigen-images which give 17.4% misclassification rate, and nearest neighbors which give 15.7% misclassification rate. 1 Introduction Until a few years ago neural network and other statistical learning techniques were not very popular in c",Computer Vision,43cca4b3de2097b9558efefd0ecc3588-Paper.pdf,1996
Interpreting images by propagating,"A central theme of computational vision research has been the re alization that reliable estimation of local scene properties requires propagating measurements across the image. Many authors have therefore suggested solving vision problems using architectures of locally connected units updating their activity in parallel. Unfor tunately, the convergence of traditional relaxation methods on such architectures has proven to be excruciatingly slow and in general they do not guarantee that the stable point will be a global mini mum. In this paper we show that an architecture in which Bayesian Be liefs about image properties are propagated between neighboring units yields convergence times which are several orders of magni tude faster than traditional methods and avoids local minima. In particular our architecture is non-iterative in the sense of Marr [5]: at every time step, the local estimates at a given location are op timal given the information which has already been propagated to that",Computer Vision,4476b929e30dd0c4e8bdbcc82c6ba23a-Paper.pdf,1996
Why did TD-Gammon Work?,"Although TD-Gammon is one of the major successes in machine learn ing, it has not led to similar impressive breakthroughs in temporal dif ference learning for other applications or even other games. We were able to replicate some of the success of TD-Gammon, developing a competitive evaluation function on a 4000 parameter feed-forward neu ral network, without using back-propagation, reinforcement or temporal difference learning methods. Instead we apply simple hill-climbing in a relative fitness environment. These results and further analysis suggest that the surprising success of Tesauro's program had more to do with the co-evolutionary structure of the learning task and the dynamics of the backgammon game itself. 1 INTRODUCTION It took great chutzpah for Gerald Tesauro to start wasting computer cycles on temporal difference learning in the game of Backgammon (Tesauro, 1992).

NeuroScale: Novel Topographic Feature,"Dimension-reducing feature extraction neural network techniques which also preserve neighbourhood relationships in data have tra ditionally been the exclusive domain of Kohonen self organising maps. Recently, we introduced a novel dimension-reducing feature extraction process, which is also topographic, based upon a Radial Basis Function architecture. It has been observed that the gener alisation performance of the system is broadly insensitive to model order complexity and other smoothing factors such as the kernel widths, contrary to intuition derived from supervised neural net work models. In this paper we provide an effective demonstration of this property and give a theoretical justification for the apparent 'self-regularising' behaviour of the 'NEUROSCALE' architecture. 1 'NeuroScale': A Feed-forward Neural Network Topographic Transformation Recently an important class of topographic neural network based feature extraction approaches, which can be related to the traditional stati",Computer Vision,4671aeaf49c792689533b00664a5c3ef-Paper.pdf,1996
Time Series Prediction Using Mixtures of,"We consider the problem of prediction of stationary time series, using the architecture known as mixtures of experts (MEM). Here we suggest a mixture which blends several autoregressive models. This study focuses on some theoretical foundations of the predic tion problem in this context. More precisely, it is demonstrated that this model is a universal approximator, with respect to learn ing the unknown prediction function. This statement is strength ened as upper bounds on the mean squared error are established. Based on these results it is possible to compare the MEM to other families of models (e.g., neural networks and state dependent mod els). It is shown that a degenerate version of the MEM is in fact equivalent to a neural network, and the number of experts in the architecture plays a similar role to the number of hidden units in the latter model. 310 A. 1.

MIMIC: Finding Optima by Estimating,"In many optimization problems, the structure of solutions reflects complex relationships between the different input parameters. For example, experience may tell us that certain parameters are closely related and should not be explored independently. Similarly, ex perience may establish that a subset of parameters must take on particular values. Any search of the cost landscape should take advantage of these relationships. We present MIMIC, a framework in which we analyze the global structure of the optimization land scape. A novel and efficient algorithm for the estimation of this structure is derived. We use knowledge of this structure to guide a randomized search through the solution space and, in turn, to re fine our estimate ofthe structure. Our technique obtains significant speed gains over other randomized optimization procedures. 1 Introduction Given some cost function C(x) with local minima, we may search for the optimal x in many ways.

GTM: A Principled Alternative,"The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm has been extensively studied and has been applied with considerable success to a wide variety of problems. However, the algorithm is derived from heuris tic ideas and this leads to a number of significant limitations. In this paper, we consider the problem of modelling the probabil ity density of data in a space of several dimensions in terms of a smaller number of latent, or hidden, variables. We introduce a novel form of latent variable model, which we call the GTM algo rithm (for Generative Topographic Mapping), which allows general non-linear transformations from latent space to data space, and which is trained using the EM (expectation-maximization) algo rithm. Our approach overcomes the limitations of the SOM, while introducing no significant disadvantages.

Support Vector Method for Function,"The Support Vector (SV) method was recently proposed for es timating regressions, constructing multidimensional splines, and solving linear operator equations [Vapnik, 1995]. In this presenta tion we report results of applying the SV method to these problems. 1 Introduction The Support Vector method is a universal tool for solving multidimensional function estimation problems. Initially it was designed to solve pattern recognition problems, where in order to find a decision rule with good generalization ability one selects some (small) subset of the training data, called the Support Vectors (SVs). Optimal separation of the SV s is equivalent to optimal separation the entire data. This led to a new method of representing decision functions where the decision functions are a linear expansion on a basis whose elements are nonlinear functions parameterized by the SVs (we need one SV for each element of the basis). This type of function representation is especially useful for high dimension",Optimization & Theoretical ML,4f284803bd0966cc24fa8683a34afc6e-Paper.pdf,1996
Smoothing Regularizers for,"Smoothing regularizers for radial basis functions have been studied extensively, but no general smoothing regularizers for projective basis junctions (PBFs), such as the widely-used sigmoidal PBFs, have heretofore been proposed.

Salient Contour Extraction by Temporal Binding,"It has been suggested that long-range intrinsic connections in striate cortex may play a role in contour extraction (Gilbert et aI., 1996).

Learning From Demonstration,"By now it is widely accepted that learning a task from scratch, i.e., without any prior knowledge, is a daunting undertaking. Humans, however, rarely at tempt to learn from scratch. They extract initial biases as well as strategies how to approach a learning problem from instructions and/or demonstrations of other humans. For learning control, this paper investigates how learning from demonstration can be applied in the context of reinforcement learning. We consider priming the Q-function, the value function, the policy, and the model of the task dynamics as possible areas where demonstrations can speed up learning. In general nonlinear learning problems, only model-based rein forcement learning shows significant speed-up after a demonstration, while in the special case of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems, all methods profit from the demonstration.

Promoting Poor Features to Supervisors:,"In supervised learning there is usually a clear distinction between inputs and outputs - inputs are what you will measure, outputs are what you will predict from those measurements. This paper shows that the distinction between inputs and outputs is not this simple. Some features are more useful as extra outputs than as inputs. By using a feature as an output we get more than just the case values but can. learn a mapping from the other inputs to that feature. For many features this mapping may be more useful than the feature value itself. We present two regression problems and one classification problem where performance improves if features that could have been used as inputs are used as extra outputs instead. This result is surprising since a feature used as an output is not used during testing. 1 Introduction The goal in supervised learning is to learn functions that map inputs to outputs with high predictive accuracy.

Representing Face Images for Emotion,"We compare the generalization performance of three distinct rep resentation schemes for facial emotions using a single classification strategy (neural network).

These splines are limited in their spatial extent using Gaus sian windowing functions. The maximisation of the likelihood leads to a set of linear equations in the spline parameters which solve the weighted least squares problem. We evaluate the technique on the localisation of road structures in aerial infra-red images. 1 Introduction Dempster, Laird and Rubin's EM (expectation and maximisation) [1] algorithm was originally introduced as a means of finding maximum likelihood solutions to prob lems posed in terms of incomplete dat",Computer Vision,71f6278d140af599e06ad9bf1ba03cb0-Paper.pdf,1996
Hidden Markov decision trees,"We study a time series model that can be viewed as a decision tree with Markov temporal structure. The model is intractable for exact calculations, thus we utilize variational approximations. We consider three different distributions for the approximation: one in which the Markov calculations are performed exactly and the layers of the decision tree are decoupled, one in which the decision tree calculations are performed exactly and the time steps of the Markov chain are decoupled, and one in which a Viterbi-like assumption is made to pick out a single most likely state sequence. We present simulation results for artificial data and the Bach chorales. 1 Introduction Decision trees are regression or classification models that are based on a nested decomposition of the input space. An input vector x is classified recursively by a set of ""decisions"" at the nonterminal nodes of a tree, resulting in the choice of a terminal node at which an output y is generated.

Combining Neural Network Regression,"When combining a set of learned models to form an improved es timator, the issue of redundancy or multicollinearity in the set of models must be addressed. A progression of existing approaches and their limitations with respect to the redundancy is discussed. A new approach, PCR* , based on principal components regres sion is proposed to address these limitations. An evaluation of the new approach on a collection of domains reveals that: 1) PCR* was the most robust combination method as the redundancy of the learned models increased, 2) redundancy could be handled without eliminating any of the learned models, and 3) the principal compo nents of the learned models provided a continuum of ""regularized"" weights from which PCR* could choose. 1 INTRODUCTION Combining a set of learned modelsl to improve classification and regres sion estimates has been an area of much research in machine learning and neural networks [Wolpert, 1992, Merz, 1995, Perrone and Cooper, 1992, Leblanc and Tibshiran",Optimization & Theoretical ML,7501e5d4da87ac39d782741cd794002d-Paper.pdf,1996
Triangulation by Continuous Embedding,"When triangulating a belief network we aim to obtain a junction tree of minimum state space. According to (Rose, 1970), searching for the optimal triangulation can be cast as a search over all the permutations of the graph's vertices. Our approach is to embed the discrete set of permutations in a convex continuous domain D. By suitably extending the cost function over D and solving the continous nonlinear optimization task we hope to obtain a good triangulation with respect to the aformentioned cost. This paper presents two ways of embedding the triangulation problem into continuous domain and shows that they perform well compared to the best known heuristic. 1 INTRODUCTION. WHAT IS TRIANGULATION? Belief networks are graphical representations of probability distributions over a set of variables. In what follows it will be always assumed that the variables take values in a finite set and that they correspond to the vertices of a graph. The graph's arcs will represent the dependencies am",Optimization & Theoretical ML,76cf99d3614e23eabab16fb27e944bf9-Paper.pdf,1996
Bayesian Model Comparison,"The techniques of Bayesian inference have been applied with great success to many problems in neural computing including evaluation of regression functions, determination of error bars on predictions, and the treatment of hyper-parameters. However, the problem of model comparison is a much more challenging one for which current techniques have significant limitations. In this paper we show how an extended form of Markov chain Monte Carlo, called chaining, is able to provide effective estimates of the relative probabilities of different models. We present results from the robot arm problem and compare them with the corresponding results obtained using the standard Gaussian approximation framework. 1 Bayesian Model Comparison In a Bayesian treatment of statistical inference, our state of knowledge of the values of the parameters w in a model M is described in terms of a probability distribution function. Initially this is chosen to be some prior distribution p(wIM), which can be combined",Optimization & Theoretical ML,7810ccd41bf26faaa2c4e1f20db70a71-Paper.pdf,1996
Practical confidence and prediction,"We propose a new method to compute prediction intervals. Espe cially for small data sets the width of a prediction interval does not only depend on the variance of the target distribution, but also on the accuracy of our estimator of the mean of the target, i.e., on the width of the confidence interval. The confidence interval follows from the variation in an ensemble of neural networks, each of them trained and stopped on bootstrap replicates of the original data set. A second improvement is the use of the residuals on validation pat terns instead of on training patterns for estimation of the variance of the target distribution. As illustrated on a synthetic example, our method is better than existing methods with regard to extrap olation and interpolation in data regimes with a limited amount of data, and yields prediction intervals which actual confidence levels are closer to the desired confidence levels. 1 STATISTICAL INTERVALS In this paper we will consider feedforward neural net",Optimization & Theoretical ML,7940ab47468396569a906f75ff3f20ef-Paper.pdf,1996
Neural Models for Part-Whole Hierarchies,"We present a connectionist method for representing images that ex plicitly addresses their hierarchical nature. It blends data from neu roscience about whole-object viewpoint sensitive cells in inferotem poral cortex8 and attentional basis-field modulation in V43 with ideas about hierarchical descriptions based on microfeatures.5,11 The resulting model makes critical use of bottom-up and top-down pathways for analysis and synthesis.6 We illustrate the model with a simple example of representing information about faces. 1 Hierarchical Models Images of objects constitute an important paradigm case of a representational hi erarchy, in which 'wholes', such as faces, consist of 'parts', such as eyes, noses and mouths.

"Consistent Classification, Firm and Soft","A classifier is called consistent with respect to a given set of class labeled points if it correctly classifies the set. We consider classi fiers defined by unions of local separators and propose algorithms for consistent classifier reduction. The expected complexities of the proposed algorithms are derived along with the expected classifier sizes. In particular, the proposed approach yields a consistent re duction of the nearest neighbor classifier, which performs ""firm"" classification, assigning each new object to a class, regardless of the data structure. The proposed reduction method suggests a notion of ""soft"" classification, allowing for indecision with respect to objects which are insufficiently or ambiguously supported by the data. The performances of the proposed classifiers in predict ing stock behavior are compared to that achieved by the nearest neighbor method. 1 Introduction Certain classification problems, such as recognizing the digits of a hand written zip code, requi",Optimization & Theoretical ML,7bb060764a818184ebb1cc0d43d382aa-Paper.pdf,1996

Because exact probability calculations with these mod els are often intractable, there is much interest in finding approxi mate algorithms. We present an algorithm that efficiently discovers higher order structure using EM and Gibbs sampling. The model can be interpreted as a stochastic recurrent network in which ambi guity in lower-level states is resolved through feedback from higher levels. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on bench mark problems. 1 Introduction Discovering high order structure in patterns is one of the keys to performing complex recognition and discrimination tasks.

An Architectural Mechanism for,"A linear architectural model of cortical simple cells is presented. The model evidences how mutual inhibition, occurring through synaptic coupling functions asymmetrically distributed in space, can be a possible basis for a wide variety of spatio-temporal simple cell response properties, including direction selectivity and velocity tuning. While spatial asymmetries are included explicitly in the structure of the inhibitory interconnections, temporal asymmetries originate from the specific mutual inhibition scheme considered. Extensive simulations supporting the model are reported. 1 INTRODUCTION One of the most distinctive features of striate cortex neurons is their combined selectivity for stimulus orientation and the direction of motion. The majority of simple cells, indeed, responds better to sinusoidal gratings that are moving in one direction than to the opposite one, exhibiting also a narrower velocity tuning with respect to that of geniculate cells.

Training Algorithms for Hidden Markov Models,"We present new algorithms for parameter estimation of HMMs. By adapting a framework used for supervised learning, we construct iterative algorithms that maximize the likelihood of the observations while also attempting to stay ""close"" to the current estimated parameters. We use a bound on the relative entropy between the two HMMs as a distance mea sure between them. The result is new iterative training algorithms which are similar to the EM (Baum-Welch) algorithm for training HMMs. The proposed algorithms are composed of a step similar to the expectation step of Baum-Welch and a new update of the parameters which replaces the maximization (re-estimation) step. The algorithm takes only negligi bly more time per iteration and an approximated version uses the same expectation step as Baum-Welch.

Schwenk & Milgram proposed a discriminant mod ular classification system (Diabolo) based on several autoassociative multilayer perceptrons which use tangent distance as error recon struction measure. We propose a gradient based constructive learning algorithm for building a tangent subspace model with discriminant capabilities which combines several of the the advantages of both HSS and Diabolo: devised tangent models hold discriminant capabilities, space requirements are improved with respect to HSS since our algorithm is discriminant and thus it needs fewer prototype models, dimension of the tangent subspace is determined automatically by the constructive algorithm, and our algorithm is able to learn new transformations.",Computer Vision,81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055-Paper.pdf,1996

Second-order Learning Algorithm with,"This paper compares three penalty terms with respect to the effi ciency of supervised learning, by using first- and second-order learn ing algorithms. Our experiments showed that for a reasonably ade quate penalty factor, the combination of the squared penalty term and the second-order learning algorithm drastically improves the convergence performance more than 20 times over the other com binations, at the same time bringing about a better generalization performance. 1 INTRODUCTION It has been found empirically that adding some penalty term to an objective func tion in the learning of neural networks can lead to significant improvements in network generalization. Such terms have been proposed on the basis of several viewpoints such as weight-decay (Hinton, 1987), regularization (Poggio & Girosi, 1990), function-smoothing (Bishop, 1995), weight-pruning (Hanson & Pratt, 1989; Ishikawa, 1990), and Bayesian priors (MacKay, 1992; Williams, 1995).

Multi-effect Decompositions,"High frequency foreign exchange data can be decomposed into three components: the inventory effect component, the surprise infonnation (news) component and the regular infonnation component. The presence of the inventory effect and news can make analysis of trends due to the diffusion of infonnation (regular information component) difficult. We propose a neural-net-based, independent component analysis to sep arate high frequency foreign exchange data into these three components. Our empirical results show that our proposed multi-effect decomposition can reveal the intrinsic price behavior. 1 Introduction Tick-by-tick, high frequency foreign exchange rates are extremely noisy and volatile, but they are not simply pure random walks (Moody & Wu 1996).

The main purpose of this research was to sys tematically compare the performance of a range of dynamic visual features on a speechreading task. We have found that normal ization of images to eliminate variation due to translation, scale, and planar rotation yielded substantial improvements in general ization performance regardless of the visual representation used. In addition, the dynamic information in the difference between suc cessive frames yielded better performance than optical-flow based approaches, and compression by local low-pass filtering worked sur prisingly better than global principal components analysis (PCA).

Microscopic Equations in Rough Energy,"We consider the microscopic equations for learning problems in neural networks. The aligning fields of an example are obtained from the cavity fields, which are the fields if that example were absent in the learning process. In a rough energy landscape, we assume that the density of the local minima obey an exponential distribution, yielding macroscopic properties agreeing with the first step replica symmetry breaking solution. Iterating the microscopic equations provide a learning algorithm, which results in a higher stability than conventional algorithms. 1 INTRODUCTION Most neural networks learn iteratively by gradient descent. As a result, closed ex pressions for the final network state after learning are rarely known.

We derive a general expression for the response function and apply it to the case of data with simple input correlations. It is found that correlations severely may slow down learning. This explains the success of PCA as a method for reducing training time. Motivated by this finding we furthermore propose to transform the input data by removing the mean across input variables as well as examples to decrease correlations. Numerical findings for a medical classification problem are in fine agreement with the theoretical results. 1 INTRODUCTION Learning and generalization are important areas of research within the field of neu ral networks.

Learning temporally persistent,"A biologically motivated model of cortical self-organization is pro posed. Context is combined with bottom-up information via a maximum likelihood cost function.

Competition Among Networks,"The separation of generalization error into two types, bias and variance (Geman, Bienenstock, Doursat, 1992), leads to the notion of error reduction by averaging over a ""committee"" of classifiers (Perrone, 1993). Committee perfonnance decreases with both the average error of the constituent classifiers and increases with the degree to which the misclassifications are correlated across the committee. Here, a method for reducing correlations is introduced, that uses a winner-take-all procedure similar to competitive learning to drive the individual networks to different minima in weight space with respect to the training set, such that correlations in generalization perfonnance will be reduced, thereby reducing committee error. 1 INTRODUCTION The problem of constructing a predictor can generally be viewed as finding the right combination of bias and variance (Geman, Bienenstock, Doursat, 1992) to reduce the expected error.

We then use LSTM, our own recent algorithm,to solve a hard problem that can neither be quicklysolved by random search nor by any other recurrent net algorithm we are aware of. 1 TRIVIAL PREVIOUS LONG TIME LAG PROBLEMS Traditional recurrent nets fail in case 'oflong minimaltime lags between input sig nals and corresponding error signals [7, 3].

Using this al gorithm large subsets of the stationary points of two test problems are found. It is shown empirically that the MLP neural network appears to have an extreme ratio of saddle points compared to local minima, and that even small neural network problems have extremely large numbers of solutions. 1 Introduction The number and type of stationary points of the error surface provide insight into the difficulties of finding the optimal parameters ofthe network, since the stationary points determine the degree of the system[l]. Unfortunately, even for the small canonical test problems commonly used in neural network studies, it is still unknown how many stationary points there are, where they are, and how these are divided into minima, maxima and saddle points.

Statistical Mechanics of the Mixture of,"We study generalization capability of the mixture of experts learn ing from examples generated by another network with the same architecture. When the number of examples is smaller than a crit ical value, the network shows a symmetric phase where the role of the experts is not specialized. Upon crossing the critical point, the system undergoes a continuous phase transition to a symme try breaking phase where the gating network partitions the input space effectively and each expert is assigned to an appropriate sub space. We also find that the mixture of experts with multiple level of hierarchy shows multiple phase transitions. 1 Introduction Recently there has been considerable interest among neural network community in techniques that integrate the collective predictions of a set of networks[l, 2, 3, 4]. The mixture of experts [1, 2] is a well known example which implements the phi losophy of divide-and-conquer elegantly.

A Mixture of Experts Classifier with,"We address statistical classifier design given a mixed training set con sisting of a small labelled feature set and a (generally larger) set of unlabelled features. This situation arises, e.g., for medical images, where although training features may be plentiful, expensive expertise is re quired to extract their class labels. We propose a classifier structure and learning algorithm that make effective use of unlabelled data to im prove performance. The learning is based on maximization of the total data likelihood, i.e. over both the labelled and unlabelled data sub sets. Two distinct EM learning algorithms are proposed, differing in the EM formalism applied for unlabelled data. The classifier, based on a joint probability model for features and labels, is a ""mixture of experts"" structure that is equivalent to the radial basis function (RBF) classifier, but unlike RBFs, is amenable to likelihood-based training.

Predicting Lifetimes in Dynamically,"Predictions oflifetimes of dynamically allocated objects can be used to improve time and space efficiency of dynamic memory manage ment in computer programs. Barrett and Zorn [1993] used a simple lifetime predictor and demonstrated this improvement on a variety of computer programs. In this paper, we use decision trees to do lifetime prediction on the same programs and show significantly better prediction. Our method also has the advantage that during training we can use a large number of features and let the decision tree automatically choose the relevant subset. 1 INTELLIGENT MEMORY ALLOCATION Dynamic memory allocation is used in many computer applications. The appli cation requests blocks of memory from the operating system or from a memory manager when needed and explicitly frees them up after use. Typically, all of these requests are handled in the same way, without any regard for how or for how long the requested block will be used.

Reinforcement Learning for Mixed,"Closed-loop control relies on sensory feedback that is usually as sumed to be free. But if sensing incurs a cost, it may be cost effective to take sequences of actions in open-loop mode. We de scribe a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns to combine open-loop and closed-loop control when sensing incurs a cost. Al though we assume reliable sensors, use of open-loop control means that actions must sometimes be taken when the current state of the controlled system is uncertain. This is a special case of the hidden-state problem in reinforcement learning, and to cope, our algorithm relies on short-term memory. The main result of the pa per is a rule that significantly limits exploration of possible memory states by pruning memory states for which the estimated value of information is greater than its cost. We prove that this rule allows convergence to an optimal policy. 1 Introduction Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely-used for learning closed-loop control poli cies.

Computing with infinite networks,"For neural networks with a wide class of weight-priors, it can be shown that in the limit of an infinite number of hidden units the prior over functions tends to a Gaussian process. In this paper an alytic forms are derived for the covariance function of the Gaussian processes corresponding to networks with sigmoidal and Gaussian hidden units. This allows predictions to be made efficiently using networks with an infinite number of hidden units, and shows that, somewhat paradoxically, it may be easier to compute with infinite networks than finite ones. 1 Introduction To someone training a neural network by maximizing the likelihood of a finite amount of data it makes no sense to use a network with an infinite number of hidden units; the network will ""overfit"" the data and so will be expected to generalize poorly. However, the idea of selecting the network size depending on the amount of training data makes little sense to a Bayesian; a model should be chosen that reflects the understand",Optimization & Theoretical ML,ae5e3ce40e0404a45ecacaaf05e5f735-Paper.pdf,1996
Regression with Input-Dependent Noise:,"In most treatments of the regression problem it is assumed that the distribution of target data can be described by a deterministic function of the inputs, together with additive Gaussian noise hav ing constant variance. The use of maximum likelihood to train such models then corresponds to the minimization of a sum-of-squares error function. In many applications a more realistic model would allow the noise variance itself to depend on the input variables. However, the use of maximum likelihood to train such models would give highly biased results. In this paper we show how a Bayesian treatment can allow for an input-dependent variance while over coming the bias of maximum likelihood. 1 Introduction In regression problems it is important not only to predict the output variables but also to have some estimate of the error bars associated with those predictions. An important contribution to the error bars arises from the intrinsic noise on the data.

The Generalisation Cost of RAMnets,"Given unlimited computational resources, it is best to use a crite rion of minimal expected generalisation error to select a model and determine its parameters. However, it may be worthwhile to sac rifice some generalisation performance for higher learning speed. A method for quantifying sub-optimality is set out here, so that this choice can be made intelligently. Furthermore, the method is applicable to a broad class of models, including the ultra-fast memory-based methods such as RAMnets. This brings the added benefit of providing, for the first time, the means to analyse the generalisation properties of such models in a Bayesian framework. 1 Introduction In order to quantitatively predict the performance of methods such as the ultra-fast RAMnet, which are not trained by minimising a cost function, we develop a Bayesian formalism for estimating the generalisation cost of a wide class of algorithms. if We consider the noisy interpolation problem, in which each output data point = res",Optimization & Theoretical ML,b24d516bb65a5a58079f0f3526c87c57-Paper.pdf,1996
Multilayer neural networks:,"We study the number of hidden layers required by a multilayer neu ral network with threshold units to compute a function f from n d to {O, I}. In dimension d = 2, Gibson characterized the functions computable with just one hidden layer, under the assumption that there is no ""multiple intersection point"" and that f is only defined on a compact set. We consider the restriction of f to the neighbor hood of a multiple intersection point or of infinity, and give neces sary and sufficient conditions for it to be locally computable with one hidden layer. We show that adding these conditions to Gib son's assumptions is not sufficient to ensure global computability with one hidden layer, by exhibiting a new non-local configuration, the ""critical cycle"", which implies that f is not computable with one hidden layer. 1 INTRODUCTION The number of hidden layers is a crucial parameter for the architecture of multilayer neural networks.

Improving the Accuracy and Speed of,"Support Vector Learning Machines (SVM) are finding application in pattern recognition, regression estimation, and operator inver sion for ill-posed problems. Against this very general backdrop, any methods for improving the generalization performance, or for improving the speed in test phase, of SVMs are of increasing in terest. In this paper we combine two such techniques on a pattern recognition problem. The method for improving generalization per formance (the ""virtual support vector"" method) does so by incor porating known invariances of the problem. This method achieves a drop in the error rate on 10,000 NIST test digit images of 1.4% to 1.0%. The method for improving the speed (the ""reduced set"" method) does so by approximating the support vector decision sur face.

Adaptive Access Control Applied to Ethernet Data,"This paper presents a method that decides which combinations of traffic can be accepted on a packet data link, so that quality of service (QoS) constraints can be met. The method uses samples of QoS results at dif ferent load conditions to build a neural network decision function. Pre vious similar approaches to the problem have a significant bias. This bias is likely to occur in any real system and results in accepting loads that miss QoS targets by orders of magnitude. Preprocessing the data to either remove the bias or provide a confidence level, the method was applied to sources based on difficult-to-analyze ethernet data traces. With this data, the method produces an accurate access control function that dramatically outperforms analytic alternatives. Interestingly, the results depend on throwing away more than 99% of the data. 1 INTRODUCTION In a communication network in which traffic sources can be dynamically added or removed, an access controller must decide when to accept or ",Computer Vision,b51a15f382ac914391a58850ab343b00-Paper.pdf,1996
An Adaptive WTA using Floating Gate,"We have designed, fabricated, and tested an adaptive Winner Take-All (WTA) circuit based upon the classic WTA of Lazzaro, et al [IJ. We have added a time dimension (adaptation) to this circuit to make the input derivative an important factor in winner selection. To accomplish this, we have modified the classic WTA circuit by adding floating gate transistors which slowly null their inputs over time.

Representation and Induction of Finite,"This work investigates the representational and inductive capabili ties of time-delay neural networks (TDNNs) in general, and of two subclasses of TDNN, those with delays only on the inputs (IDNN), and those which include delays on hidden units (HDNN). Both ar chitectures are capable of representing the same class of languages, the definite memory machine (DMM) languages, but the delays on the hidden units in the HDNN helps it outperform the IDNN on problems composed of repeated features over short time windows. 1 Introduction In this paper we consider the representational and inductive capabilities of time delay neural networks (TDNN) [Waibel et al., 1989] [Lang et al., 1990], also known as NNFIR [Wan, 1993].

On several artificial benchmark problems, this algorithm compares favorably with other resample and combine techniques. 1 Introduction The training of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is usually a stochastic and unsta ble process. As the weights of the network are initialized at random and training patterns are presented in random order, ANNs trained on the same data will typ ically be different in value and performance. In addition, small changes in the training set can lead to two completely different trained networks with different performance even if the nets had the same initial weights.

Estimating Equivalent Kernels For Neural,"We describe the notion of ""equivalent kernels"" and suggest that this provides a framework for comparing different classes of regression models, including neural networks and both parametric and non-parametric statistical techniques. Unfortunately, standard techniques break down when faced with models, such as neural networks, in which there is more than one ""layer"" of adjustable parameters. We propose an algorithm which overcomes this limitation, estimating the equivalent kernels for neural network models using a data perturbation approach. Experimental results indicate that the networks do not use the maximum possible number of degrees of freedom, that these can be controlled using regularisation techniques and that the equivalent kernels learnt by the network vary both in ""size"" and in ""shape"" in different regions of the input space. 1 INTRODUCTION The dominant approaches within the statistical community, such as multiple linear regression but even extending to advanced techniques su",Optimization & Theoretical ML,c70daf247944fe3add32218f914c75a6-Paper.pdf,1996
Monotonicity Hints,"A hint is any piece of side information about the target function to be learned.

The application of mono tonicity hints is demonstrated on two real-world problems- a credit card application task, and a problem in medical diagnosis. A measure of the monotonicity error of a candidate function is defined and an objective function for the enforcement of monotonicity is derived from Bayesian principles. We report experimental results which show that using monotonicity hints leads to a statistically significant improvement in performance on both problems. 1 Introduction Researchers in pattern recognition, statistics, and machine learning often draw a contrast between linear models and nonlinear models such as neural networks.

Quadratic assignment problems (QAP) are char acterized by quadratic objectives with the variables obeying permutation matrix constraints. Problems that roughly fall into this class are TSP, graph partitioning (GP) and graph matching.

Size of multilayer networks for exact,"This article presents a new result about the size of a multilayer neural network computing real outputs for exact learning of a finite set of real samples. The architecture of the network is feedforward, with one hidden layer and several outputs. Starting from a fixed training set, we consider the network as a function of its weights. We derive, for a wide family of transfer functions, a lower and an upper bound on the number of hidden units for exact learning, given the size of the dataset and the dimensions of the input and output spaces. 1 RELATED WORKS The context of our work is rather similar to the well-known results of Baum et al.

Removing Noise in On-Line Search using,"Stochastic (on-line) learning can be faster than batch learning. However, at late times, the learning rate must be annealed to re move the noise present in the stochastic weight updates. In this annealing phase, the convergence rate (in mean square) is at best proportional to l/T where T is the number of input presentations. An alternative is to increase the batch size to remove the noise. In this paper we explore convergence for LMS using 1) small but fixed batch sizes and 2) an adaptive batch size. We show that the best adaptive batch schedule is exponential and has a rate of conver gence which is the same as for annealing, Le., at best proportional to l/T. 1 Introduction Stochastic (on-line) learning can speed learning over its batch training particularly ,,,,hen data sets are large and contain redundant information [M0l93J.

An Hierarchical Model of Visual Rivalry,"Binocular rivalry is the alternating percept that can result when the two eyes see different scenes. Recent psychophysical evidence supports an account for one component of binocular rivalry similar to that for other bistable percepts. We test the hypothesisl9, 16, 18 that alternation can be generated by competition between top down cortical explanations for the inputs, rather than by direct competition between the inputs. Recent neurophysiological ev idence shows that some binocular neurons are modulated with the changing percept; others are not, even if they are selective be tween the stimuli presented to the eyes. We extend our model to a hierarchy to address these effects. 1 Introduction Although binocular rivalry leads to distinct perceptual distress, it is revealing about the mechanisms of visual information processing.

As a first step in investigating the relation between the system and its inputs, we study low-order statistical properties in several sound ensembles using a filter bank analysis. Focusing on the amplitude and phase in different frequency bands, we find simple parametric descriptions for their distribution and power spectrum that are valid for very different types of sounds. In particular, the amplitude distribution has an exponential tail and its power spectrum exhibits a modified power-law behavior, which is manifested by self-similarity and long-range temporal cor relations. Furthermore, the statistics for different bands within a given ensemble are virtually identical, suggesting translation in variance along the cochlear axis.

A spike based learning neuron in analog,"Many popular learning rules are formulated in terms of continu ous, analog inputs and outputs. Biological systems, however, use action potentials, which are digital-amplitude events that encode analog information in the inter-event interval. Action-potential representations are now being used to advantage in neuromorphic VLSI systems as well. We report on a simple learning rule, based on the Riccati equation described by Kohonen [1], modified for action-potential neuronal outputs.

One-unit Learning Rules for,"Neural one-unit learning rules for the problem of Independent Com ponent Analysis (ICA) and blind source separation are introduced. In these new algorithms, every ICA neuron develops into a sepa rator that finds one of the independent components. The learning rules use very simple constrained Hebbianjanti-Hebbian learning in which decorrelating feedback may be added. To speed up the convergence of these stochastic gradient descent rules, a novel com putationally efficient fixed-point algorithm is introduced. 1 Introduction Independent Component Analysis (ICA) (Comon, 1994; Jutten and Herault, 1991) is a signal processing technique whose goal is to express a set of random vari ables as linear combinations of statistically independent component variables. The main applications of ICA are in blind source separation, feature extraction, and blind deconvolution. In the simplest form of ICA (Comon, 1994), we observe m scalar random variables Xl, ... , Xm which are assumed to be linear combin",Optimization & Theoretical ML,dfd7468ac613286cdbb40872c8ef3b06-Paper.pdf,1996
Analysis of Temporal-Difference Learning,"We present new results about the temporal-difference learning al gorithm, as applied to approximating the cost-to-go function of a Markov chain using linear function approximators. The algo rithm we analyze performs on-line updating of a parameter vector during a single endless trajectory of an aperiodic irreducible finite state Markov chain. Results include convergence (with probability 1), a characterization of the limit of convergence, and a bound on the resulting approximation error. In addition to establishing new and stronger results than those previously available, our analysis is based on a new line of reasoning that provides new intuition about the dynamics of temporal-difference learning. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of two counter-examples with regards to the Significance of on-line updating and linearly parameterized function approximators. 1 INTRODUCTION The problem of predicting the expected long-term future cost (or reward) of a stochastic dynamic system mani",Reinforcement Learning,e00406144c1e7e35240afed70f34166a-Paper.pdf,1996
Fast Network Pruning and Feature,"The algorithm described in this article is based on the OBS algo rithm by Hassibi, Stork and Wolff ([1] and [2]). The main disad vantage of OBS is its high complexity. OBS needs to calculate the inverse Hessian to delete only one weight (thus needing much time to prune a big net). A better algorithm should use this matrix to remove more than only one weight, because calculating the inverse Hessian takes the most time in the OBS algorithm. The algorithm, called Unit-OBS, described in this article is a method to overcome this disadvantage. This algorithm only needs to calculate the inverse Hessian once to remove one whole unit thus drastically reducing the time to prune big nets. A further advantage of Unit-OBS is that it can be used to do a feature extraction on the input data. This can be helpful on the understanding of unknown problems. 1 Introduction This article is based on the technical report [3] about speeding up the OBS algo rithm. The main target of this work was to reduce the ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,e034fb6b66aacc1d48f445ddfb08da98-Paper.pdf,1996
Learning with Noise and Regularizers,"We study the effect of noise and regularization in an on-line gradient-descent learning scenario for a general two-layer student network with an arbitrary number of hidden units. Training ex amples are randomly drawn input vectors labeled by a two-layer teacher network with an arbitrary number of hidden units; the ex amples are corrupted by Gaussian noise affecting either the output or the model itself. We examine the effect of both types of noise and that of weight-decay regularization on the dynamical evolu tion of the order parameters and the generalization error in various phases of the learning process. 1 Introduction One of the most powerful and commonly used methods for training large layered neural networks is that of on-line learning, whereby the internal network parameters {J} are modified after the presentation of each training example so as to minimize the corresponding error.

The Learning Dynamics of,"The learning properties of a universal approximator, a normalized committee machine with adjustable biases, are studied for on-line back-propagation learning. Within a statistical mechanics frame work, numerical studies show that this model has features which do not exist in previously studied two-layer network models with out adjustable biases, e.g., attractive suboptimal symmetric phases even for realizable cases and noiseless data. 1 INTRODUCTION Recently there has been much interest in the theoretical breakthrough in the un derstanding of the on-line learning dynamics of multi-layer feedforward perceptrons (MLPs) using a statistical mechanics framework. In the seminal paper (Saad & Solla, 1995), a two-layer network with an arbitrary number of hidden units was studied, allowing insight into the learning behaviour of neural network models whose complexity is of the same order as those used in real world applications.

Gaussian Processes for Bayesian,"The full Bayesian method for applying neural networks to a pre diction problem is to set up the prior/hyperprior structure for the net and then perform the necessary integrals. However, these inte grals are not tractable analytically, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are slow, especially if the parameter space is high-dimensional. Using Gaussian processes we can approximate the weight space integral analytically, so that only a small number of hyperparameters need be integrated over by MCMC methods. We have applied this idea to classification problems, obtaining ex cellent results on the real-world problems investigated so far. 1 INTRODUCTION To make predictions based on a set of training data, fundamentally we need to combine our prior beliefs about possible predictive functions with the data at hand. In the Bayesian approach to neural networks a prior on the weights in the net induces a prior distribution over functions.

This paper extends these results in two directions. First, in a large-scale empirical comparison of problems that have been reported in GA literature, we show that on many prob lems, simpler algorithms can perform significantly better than GAs. Second, we describe when crossover is useful, and show how it can be incorporated into PBIL. 1 IMPLICIT VS.

Efficient Nonlinear Control with,"A new reinforcement learning architecture for nonlinear control is proposed. A direct feedback controller, or the actor, is trained by a value-gradient based controller, or the tutor. This architecture enables both efficient use of the value function and simple computa tion for real-time implementation. Good performance was verified in multi-dimensional nonlinear control tasks using Gaussian soft max networks. 1 INTRODUCTION In the study of temporal difference (TD) learning in continuous time and space (Doya, 1996b), an optimal nonlinear feedback control law was derived using the gradient of the value function and the local linear model of the system dynam ics. It was demonstrated in the simulation of a pendulum swing-up task that the value-gradient based control scheme requires much less learning trials than the con ventional ""actor-critic"" control scheme (Barto et al., 1983).

Learning Exact Patterns of Quasi-synchronization,This paper develops arguments for a family of temporal log-linear models to represent spatio-temporal correlations among the spiking events in a group of neurons. The models can represent not just pairwise correlations but also correlations of higher order. Methods are discussed for inferring the existence or absence of correlations and estimating their strength. A frequentist and a Bayesian approach to correlation detection are compared. The frequentist method is based on G 2 statistic with estimates obtained via the Max-Ent principle. In the Bayesian approach a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Model Composition (MC3) algorithm is applied to search over connectivity structures and Laplace's method is used to approximate their posterior probability. Performance of the methods was tested on synthetic data.

Interpolating Earth-science Data using RBF,"We present a mixture of experts (ME) approach to interpolate sparse, spatially correlated earth-science data. Kriging is an interpolation method which uses a global covariation model estimated from the data to take account of the spatial dependence in the data. Based on the close relationship between kriging and the radial basis function (RBF) network (Wan & Bone, 1996), we use a mixture of generalized RBF networks to partition the input space into statistically correlated regions and learn the local covariation model of the data in each region. Applying the ME approach to simulated and real-world data, we show that it is able to achieve good partitioning of the input space, learn the local covariation models and improve generalization.",Optimization & Theoretical ML,f09696910bdd874a99cd74c8f05b5c44-Paper.pdf,1996
Statistically Efficient Estimation Using,"Coarse codes are widely used throughout the brain to encode sen sory and motor variables. Methods designed to interpret these codes, such as population vector analysis, are either inefficient, i.e., the variance of the estimate is much larger than the smallest possi ble variance, or biologically implausible, like maximum likelihood. Moreover, these methods attempt to compute a scalar or vector estimate of the encoded variable. Neurons are faced with a simi lar estimation problem. They must read out the responses of the presynaptic neurons, but, by contrast, they typically encode the variable with a further population code rather than as a scalar. We show how a non-linear recurrent network can be used to per form these estimation in an optimal way while keeping the estimate in a coarse code format. This work suggests that lateral connec tions in the cortex may be involved in cleaning up uncorrelated noise among neurons representing similar variables. 1 Introduction Most sensory and moto",Computer Vision,f29b38f160f87ae86df31cee1982066f-Paper.pdf,1996

Clustering via Concave Minimization,"The problem of assigning m points in the n-dimensional real space Rn to k clusters is formulated as that of determining k centers in Rn such that the sum of distances of each point to the nearest center is minimized. If a polyhedral distance is used, the problem can be formulated as that of minimizing a piecewise-linear concave function on a polyhedral set which is shown to be equivalent to a bilinear program: minimizing a bilinear function on a polyhe dral set. A fast finite k-Median Algorithm consisting of solving few linear programs in closed form leads to a stationary point of the bilinear program. Computational testing on a number of real world databases was carried out. On the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) database, k-Median training set correct ness was comparable to that of the k-Mean Algorithm, however its testing set correctness was better.

Balancing between bagging and bumping,"We compare different methods to combine predictions from neu ral networks trained on different bootstrap samples of a regression problem. One of these methods, introduced in [6] and which we here call balancing, is based on the analysis of the ensemble gen eralization error into an ambiguity term and a term incorporating generalization performances of individual networks. We show how to estimate these individual errors from the residuals on valida tion patterns. Weighting factors for the different networks follow from a quadratic programming problem. On a real-world problem concerning the prediction of sales figures and on the well-known Boston housing data set, balancing clearly outperforms other re cently proposed alternatives as bagging [1] and bumping [8]. 1 EARLY STOPPING AND BOOTSTRAPPING Stopped training is a popular strategy to prevent overfitting in neural networks.

First, two novel algorithms for self-organization are derived from a two-layer linear hetero-associative network performing a one-of-m classification, and trained with the constrained least-mean-squared classification error criterion. Second, two adaptive algorithms are derived from these self organizing procedures to compute the principal generalized eigenvectors of two correlation matrices from two sequences of random vectors. These novel adaptive algorithms can be implemented in a single-layer linear feed-forward network.

Multi-Grid Methods for Reinforcement,"Reinforcement learning methods for discrete and semi-Markov de cision problems such as Real-Time Dynamic Programming can be generalized for Controlled Diffusion Processes. The optimal control problem reduces to a boundary value problem for a fully nonlinear second-order elliptic differential equation of Hamilton Jacobi-Bellman (HJB-) type. Numerical analysis provides multi grid methods for this kind of equation. In the case of Learning Con trol, however, the systems of equations on the various grid-levels are obtained using observed information (transitions and local cost). To ensure consistency, special attention needs to be directed to ward the type of time and space discretization during the obser vation. An algorithm for multi-grid observation is proposed. The multi-grid algorithm is demonstrated on a simple queuing problem. 1 Introduction Controlled Diffusion Processes (CDP) are the analogy to Markov Decision Problems in continuous state space and continuous time.

Noisy Spiking Neurons with Temporal,"We exhibit a novel way of simulating sigmoidal neural nets by net works of noisy spiking neurons in temporal coding. Furthermore it is shown that networks of noisy spiking neurons with temporal coding have a strictly larger computational power than sigmoidal neural nets with the same number of units. 1 Introduction and Definitions We consider a formal model SNN for a Â§piking neuron network that is basically a reformulation of the spike response model (and of the leaky integrate and fire model) without using 6-functions (see [Maass, 1996a] or [Maass, 1996b] for further backgrou nd).

"For valid generalization, the size of the","This paper shows that if a large neural network is used for a pattern classification problem, and the learning algorithm finds a network with small weights that has small squared error on the training patterns, then the generalization performance depends on the size of the weights rather than the number of weights. More specifi cally, consider an i-layer feed-forward network of sigmoid units, in which the sum of the magnitudes of the weights associated with each unit is bounded by A. The misclassification probability con verges to an error estimate (that is closely related to squared error on the training set) at rate O((cA)l(l+1)/2J(log n)jm) ignoring log factors, where m is the number of training patterns, n is the input dimension, and c is a constant. This may explain the gen eralization performance of neural networks, particularly when the number of training examples is considerably smaller than the num ber of weights. It also supports heuristics (such as weight decay and early sto",Optimization & Theoretical ML,fb2fcd534b0ff3bbed73cc51df620323-Paper.pdf,1996
Edges are the 'Independent Components' of,"Field (1994) has suggested that neurons with line and edge selectivities found in primary visual cortex of cats and monkeys form a sparse, dis tributed representation of natural scenes, and Barlow (1989) has reasoned that such responses should emerge from an unsupervised learning algorithm that attempts to find a factorial code of independent visual features. We show here that non-linear 'infomax', when applied to an ensemble of nat ural scenes, produces sets of visual filters that are localised and oriented. Some of these filters are Gabor-like and resemble those produced by the sparseness-maximisation network of Olshausen & Field (1996). In addition, the outputs of these filters are as independent as possible, since the info max network is able to perform Independent Components Analysis (ICA). We compare the resulting ICA filters and their associated basis functions, with other decorrelating filters produced by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and zero-phase whitening filters (ZCA",Computer Vision,f9be311e65d81a9ad8150a60844bb94c-Paper.pdf,1996
Neural Network Modeling of Speech and Music,Time series prediction is one of the major applications of neural net works. After a short introduction into the basic theoretical foundations we argue that the iterated prediction of a dynamical system may be in terpreted as a model of the system dynamics. By means of RBF neural networks we describe a modeling approach and extend it to be able to model instationary systems. As a practical test for the capabilities of the method we investigate the modeling of musical and speech signals and demonstrate that the model may be used for synthesis of musical and speech signals. 1 Introduction Since the formulation of the reconstruction theorem by Takens [10] it has been clear that a nonlinear predictor of a dynamical system may be directly derived from a systems time series. The method has been investigated extensively and with good success for the pre diction of time series of nonlinear systems.

Rapid Visual Processing using Spike Asynchrony,"We have investigated the possibility that rapid processing in the visual system could be achieved by using the order of firing in different neurones as a code, rather than more conventional firing rate schemes. Using SPIKENET, a neural net simulator based on integrate-and-fire neurones and in which neurones in the input layer function as analog to-delay converters, we have modeled the initial stages of visual processing. Initial results are extremely promising. Even with activity in retinal output cells limited to one spike per neuron per image (effectively ruling out any form of rate coding), sophisticated processing based on asynchronous activation was nonetheless possible.",Computer Vision,fd5c905bcd8c3348ad1b35d7231ee2b1-Paper.pdf,1996
Visual Cortex Circuitry and Orientation,"A simple mathematical model for the large-scale circuitry of pri mary visual cortex is introduced. It is shown that a basic cor tical architecture of recurrent local excitation and lateral inhi bition can account quantitatively for such properties as orien tation tuning. The model can also account for such local ef fects as cross-orientation suppression. It is also shown that non local state-dependent coupling between similar orientation patches, when added to the model, can satisfactorily reproduce such ef fects as non-local iso--orientation suppression, and non-local cross orientation enhancement. Following this an account is given of per ceptual phenomena involving object segmentation, such as ""pop out"", and the direct and indirect tilt illusions. 1 INTRODUCTION The edge detection mechanism in the primate visual cortex (VI) involves at least two fairly well characterized circuits.

Orientation contrast sensitivity from,"Recently Sill ito and coworkers (Nature 378, pp. 492,1995) demon strated that stimulation beyond the classical receptive field (cRF) can not only modulate, but radically change a neuron's response to oriented stimuli. They revealed that patch-suppressed cells when stimulated with contrasting orientations inside and outside their cRF can strongly respond to stimuli oriented orthogonal to their nominal preferred orientation. Here we analyze the emergence of such complex response patterns in a simple model of primary vi sual cortex. We show that the observed sensitivity for orientation contrast can be explained by a delicate interplay between local isotropic interactions and patchy long-range connectivity between distant iso-orientation domains. In particular we demonstrate that the observed properties might arise without specific connections be tween sites with cross-oriented cRFs. 1 Introduction Long range horizontal connections form a ubiquitous structural element of intra cortical cir",Computer Vision,fe51510c80bfd6e5d78a164cd5b1f688-Paper.pdf,1996
Prior Knowledge in Support Vector Kernels,"We explore methods for incorporating prior knowledge about a problem at hand in Support Vector learning machines. We show that both invari ances under group transfonnations and prior knowledge about locality in images can be incorporated by constructing appropriate kernel functions. 1 INTRODUCTION When we are trying to extract regularities from data, we often have additional knowledge about functions that we estimate. For instance, in image classification tasks, there exist transfonnations which leave class membership invariant (e.g. local translations); moreover, it is usually the case that images have a local structure in that not all correlations between image regions carry equal amounts of infonnation. The present study investigates the question how to make use of these two sources of know ledge by designing appropriate Support Vector (SV) kernel functions.

Dynamic Stochastic Synapses as,"In most neural network models, synapses are treated as static weights that change only on the slow time scales of learning. In fact, however, synapses are highly dynamic, and show use-dependent plasticity over a wide range of time scales. Moreover, synaptic transmission is an inherently stochastic process: a spike arriving at a presynaptic terminal triggers release of a vesicle of neurotransmitter from a release site with a probability that can be much less than one. Changes in release probability represent one of the main mechanisms by which synaptic efficacy is modulated in neural circuits. We propose and investigate a simple model for dynamic stochastic synapses that can easily be integrated into common models for neural computation. We show through computer simulations and rigorous theoretical analysis that this model for a dynamic stochastic synapse increases computational power in a nontrivial way.

Self-similarity properties of natural images,"Scale invariance is a fundamental property of ensembles of nat ural images [1]. Their non Gaussian properties [15, 16] are less well understood, but they indicate the existence of a rich statis tical structure. In this work we present a detailed study of the marginal statistics of a variable related to the edges in the images. A numerical analysis shows that it exhibits extended self-similarity [3, 4, 5]. This is a scaling property stronger than self-similarity: all its moments can be expressed as a power of any given moment. More interesting, all the exponents can be predicted in terms of a multiplicative log-Poisson process. This is the very same model that was used very recently to predict the correct exponents of the structure functions of turbulent flows [6].

Learning Continuous Attractors in,"One approach to invariant object recognition employs a recurrent neu ral network as an associative memory. In the standard depiction of the network's state space, memories of objects are stored as attractive fixed points of the dynamics. I argue for a modification of this picture: if an object has a continuous family of instantiations, it should be represented by a continuous attractor. This idea is illustrated with a network that learns to complete patterns. To perform the task of filling in missing in formation, the network develops a continuous attractor that models the manifold from which the patterns are drawn. From a statistical view point, the pattern completion task allows a formulation of unsupervised learning in terms of regression rather than density estimation. A classic approach to invariant object recognition is to use a recurrent neural net work as an associative memory[l].

Our method results in solutions having smaller test errors than that of simple training solution, especially for noisy problems or small training sets. 1 Introduction We introduce an estimator of test error that takes into consideration the test inputs. The new estimator, augmented error, is composed of the training error and an additional term computed using the test inputs. In some applications, such as credit default prediction and medical image recognition, we do have access to the test inputs. In our experiments, we found that the augmented error (which is computed without looking at the test outputs but only test inputs and training examples) can result in a smaller test error. In particular, it tends to increase when the test error increases (overtraining)",Optimization & Theoretical ML,0e55666a4ad822e0e34299df3591d979-Paper.pdf,1997
An application of Reversible-J ump,Applications of Gaussian mixture models occur frequently in the fields of statistics and artificial neural networks. One of the key issues arising from any mixture model application is how to es timate the optimum number of mixture components. This paper extends the Reversible-Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to the case of multivariate spherical Gaussian mixtures using a hierarchical prior model. Using this method the number of mixture components is no longer fixed but becomes a param eter of the model which we shall estimate. The Reversible-Jump MCMC algorithm is capable of moving between parameter sub spaces which correspond to models with different numbers of mix ture components. As a result a sample from the full joint distribu tion of all unknown model parameters is generated. The technique is then demonstrated on a simulated example and a well known vowel dataset. 1 Introduction Applications of Gaussian mixture models regularly appear in the neural networks literat,Optimization & Theoretical ML,0ed9422357395a0d4879191c66f4faa2-Paper.pdf,1997

Intrusion Detection with Neural Networks,"With the rapid expansion of computer networks during the past few years, security has become a crucial issue for modern computer systems. A good way to detect illegitimate use is through monitoring unusual user activity. Methods of intrusion detection based on hand-coded rule sets or predicting commands on-line are laborous to build or not very reliable. This paper proposes a new way of applying neural networks to detect intrusions. We believe that a user leaves a 'print' when using the system; a neural network can be used to learn this print and identify each user much like detectives use thumbprints to place people at crime scenes. If a user's behavior does not match hislher print, the system administrator can be alerted of a possible security breech. A backpropagation neural network called NNID (Neural Network Intrusion Detector) was trained in the identification task and tested experimentally on a system of 10 users.

Incorporating Contextual Information in White,"In this paper we propose a technique to incorporate contextual informa tion into object classification. In the real world there are cases where the identity of an object is ambiguous due to the noise in the measurements based on which the classification should be made. It is helpful to re duce the ambiguity by utilizing extra information referred to as context, which in our case is the identities of the accompanying objects. This technique is applied to white blood cell classification. Comparisons are made against ""no context"" approach, which demonstrates the superior classification performance achieved by using context. In our particular application, it significantly reduces false alarm rate and thus greatly re duces the cost due to expensive clinical tests. â¢ Author for correspondence.

Mapping a manifold of perceptual observations,"Nonlinear dimensionality reduction is formulated here as the problem of trying to find a Euclidean feature-space embedding of a set of observations that preserves as closely as possible their intrinsic metric structure - the distances between points on the observation manifold as measured along geodesic paths. Our isometric feature mapping procedure, or isomap, is able to reliably recover low-dimensional nonlinear structure in realistic perceptual data sets, such as a manifold of face images, where conventional global mapping methods find only local minima. The recovered map provides a canonical set of globally meaningful features, which allows perceptual transformations such as interpolation, extrapolation, and analogy - highly nonlinear transformations in the original observation space - to be computed with simple linear operations in feature space. 1 Introduction In psychological or computational research on perceptual categorization, it is generally taken for granted that the perce",Computer Vision,28e209b61a52482a0ae1cb9f5959c792-Paper.pdf,1997

In this paper, we attempt to answer these ques tions in the context of a Kalman filter-based model of visual recognition that has previously proved useful in explaining certain neurophysiological phe nomena such as endstopping and related extra-classical receptive field ef fects in the visual cortex. By using results from the field of robust statistics, we describe an extension of the Kalman filter model that can handle multiple objects in the visual field.

Two multimodal examples, the competitive and cooperative distributions, illustrate the representational power of the rectified Gaussian. Since the cooperative distribution can rep resent the translations of a pattern, it demonstrates the potential of the rectified Gaussian for modeling pattern manifolds. 1 INTRODUCTION The rectified Gaussian distribution is a modification of the standard Gaussian in which the variables are constrained to be nonnegative.

"RCC Cannot Compute Certain FSA,","Existing proofs demonstrating the computational limitations of Re current Cascade Correlation and similar networks (Fahlman, 1991; Bachrach, 1988; Mozer, 1988) explicitly limit their results to units having sigmoidal or hard-threshold transfer functions (Giles et aI., 1995; and Kremer, 1996). The proof given here shows that for any finite, discrete transfer function used by the units of an RCC network, there are finite-state automata (FSA) that the network cannot model, no matter how many units are used. The proof also applies to continuous transfer functions with a finite number of fixed-points, such as sigmoid and radial-basis functions. 1 Introduction The Recurrent Cascade Correlation (RCC) network was proposed by Fahlman (1991) to offer a fast and efficient alternative to fully connected recurrent networks.

In this paper we examine several techniques for local dimensionality reduction in the context of locally weighted linear re gression.

Adaptation in Speech Motor Control,"Human subjects are known to adapt their motor behavior to a shift of the visual field brought about by wearing prism glasses over their eyes. We have studied the analog of this effect in speech. Us ing a device that can feed back transformed speech signals in real time, we exposed subjects to alterations of their own speech feedback. We found that speakers learn to adjust their production of a vowel to compensate for feedback alterations that change the vowel's perceived phonetic identity; moreover, the effect generalizes across consonant contexts and to different vowels. 1 INTRODUCTION For more than a century, it has been know that humans will adapt their reaches to altered visual feedback [8]. One of the most studied examples of this adaptation is prism adaptation, which is seen when a subject reaches to targets while wearing image-shifting prism glasses [2]. Initially, the subject misses the targets, but he soon learns to compensate and reach accurately. This compensation is retaine",NLP,2dffbc474aa176b6dc957938c15d0c8b-Paper.pdf,1997

Competitive On-Line Linear Regression,"We apply a general algorithm for merging prediction strategies (the Aggregating Algorithm) to the problem of linear regression with the square loss; our main assumption is that the response variable is bounded. It turns out that for this particular problem the Aggre gating Algorithm resembles, but is slightly different from, the well known ridge estimation procedure. From general results about the Aggregating Algorithm we deduce a guaranteed bound on the dif ference between our algorithm's performance and the best, in some sense, linear regression function's performance. We show that the AA attains the optimal constant in our bound, whereas the con stant attained by the ridge regression procedure in general can be 4 times worse. 1 INTRODUCTION The usual approach to regression problems is to assume that the data are gen erated by some stochastic mechanism and make some, typically very restrictive, assumptions about that stochastic mechanism.

This can be viewed as non-Gaussian multidi mensional density estimation exploiting certain conditional independencies in the variables. Markov networks are a graphical way of describing con ditional independencies well suited to model relationships which do not ex hibit a natural causal ordering. We use neural network structures to model the quantitative relationships between variables. The main focus in this pa per will be on learning the structure for the purpose of gaining insight into the underlying process. Using two data sets we show that interesting struc tures can be found using our approach.

Online learning from finite training sets,"Online learning is one of the most common forms of neural net work training. We present an analysis of online learning from finite training sets for non-linear networks (namely, soft-committee ma chines), advancing the theory to more realistic learning scenarios. Dynamical equations are derived for an appropriate set of order parameters; these are exact in the limiting case of either linear networks or infinite training sets. Preliminary comparisons with simulations suggest that the theory captures some effects of finite training sets, but may not yet account correctly for the presence of local minima. 1 INTRODUCTION The analysis of online gradient descent learning, as one of the most common forms of supervised learning, has recently stimulated a great deal of interest [1, 5, 7, 3].

Automated Aircraft Recovery,"Initial experiments described here were directed toward using reinforce ment learning (RL) to develop an automated recovery system (ARS) for high-agility aircraft. An ARS is an outer-loop flight-control system de signed to bring an aircraft from a range of out-of-control states to straight and-level flight in minimum time while satisfying physical and phys iological constraints. Here we report on results for a simple version of the problem involving only single-axis (pitch) simulated recoveries. Through simulated control experience using a medium-fidelity aircraft simulation, the RL system approximates an optimal policy for pitch-stick inputs to produce minimum-time transitions to straight-and-Ievel flight in unconstrained cases while avoiding ground-strike.

Graph Matching with Hierarchical,"Our aim in this paper is to develop a Bayesian framework for match ing hierarchical relational models. The goal is to make discrete la bel assignments so as to optimise a global cost function that draws information concerning the consistency of match from different lev els of the hierarchy. Our Bayesian development naturally distin guishes between intra-level and inter-level constraints. This allows the impact of reassigning a match to be assessed not only at its own (or peer) level ofrepresentation, but also upon its parents and children in the hierarchy. 1 Introd uction Hierarchical graphical structures are of critical importance in the interpretation of sensory or perceptual data.

The construction assumes symmetric interactions within excitatory and inhibitory populations of neurons, and antisymmetric interactions be tween populations. The Lyapunov function yields sufficient conditions for the global asymptotic stability of fixed points. If these conditions are violated, limit cycles may be stable. The relations of the Lyapunov function to optimization theory and classical mechanics are revealed by minimax and dissipative Hamiltonian forms of the network dynamics. The dynamics of a neural network with symmetric interactions provably converges to fixed points under very general assumptions[l, 2]. This mathematical result helped to establish the paradigm of neural computation with fixed point attractors[3]. But in reality, interactions between neurons in the brain are asymmetric. Furthermore, the dynamical behaviors seen in the brain are not confined to fixed point attractors, but also include ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,3d779cae2d46cf6a8a99a35ba4167977-Paper.pdf,1997

Modeling Complex Cells in an A wake,"We model the responses of cells in visual area VI during natural vision. Our model consists of a classical energy mechanism whose output is divided by nonclassical gain control and texture contrast mechanisms. We apply this model to review movies, a stimulus sequence that replicates the stimulation a cell receives during free viewing of natural images. Data were collected from three cells using five different review movies, and the model was fit separately to the data from each movie. For the energy mechanism alone we find modest but significant correlations (rE = 0.41, 0.43, 0.59, 0.35) between model and data. These correlations are improved somewhat when we allow for suppressive surround effects (rE+G = 0.42, 0.56, 0.60, 0.37).

In this paper, the shape that such a gradient might have is calculated as a function of distance from the target and the time since the start of factor production. Using estimates of the relevant parameter values from the experimental literature, the spatiotemporal domain in which a growth cone could detect such a gradient is derived. For large times, a value for the maximum guidance range of about 1 mm is obtained. This value fits well with experimental data. For smaller times, the analysis predicts that guidance over longer ranges may be possible. This prediction remains to be tested. 1 Introduction In the developing nervous system, growing axons are guided to targets that may be some distance away. Several mechanisms contribute to this (reviewed in Tessier Lavigne & Goodman (1996Â». One such mechanism is the diffusion of a factor from the ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,512c5cad6c37edb98ae91c8a76c3a291-Paper.pdf,1997
Asymptotic Theory for Regularization:,"The generalization ability of a neural network can sometimes be improved dramatically by regularization. To analyze the improve ment one needs more refined results than the asymptotic distri bution of the weight vector. Here we study the simple case of one-dimensional linear regression under quadratic regularization, i.e., ridge regression. We study the random design, misspecified case, where we derive expansions for the optimal regularization pa rameter and the ensuing improvement. It is possible to construct examples where it is best to use no regularization. 1 INTRODUCTION Suppose that we have available training data (Xl, Yd, .. 0' (Xn' Yn) consisting of pairs of vectors, and we try to predict Yi on the basis of Xi with a neural network with weight vector w.

Neural Basis of Object-Centered,"We present a neural model that can perform eye movements to a particular side of an object regardless of the position and orienta tion of the object in space, a generalization of a task which has been recently used by Olson and Gettner [4] to investigate the neu ral structure of object-centered representations. Our model uses an intermediate representation in which units have oculocentric recep tive fields-just like collicular neurons-whose gain is modulated by the side of the object to which the movement is directed, as well as the orientation of the object. We show that these gain modulations are consistent with Olson and Gettner's single cell recordings in the supplementary eye field. This demonstrates that it is possible to perform an object-centered task without a representation involv ing an object-centered map, viz., without neurons whose receptive fields are defined in object-centered coordinates. We also show that the same approach can account for object-centered neglect, a si",Computer Vision,540ae6b0f6ac6e155062f3dd4f0b2b01-Paper.pdf,1997
Modelling Seasonality and Trends in Daily,"This paper presents a new approach to the problem of modelling daily rainfall using neural networks. We first model the conditional distribu tions of rainfall amounts, in such a way that the model itself determines the order of the process, and the time-dependent shape and scale of the conditional distributions. After integrating over particular weather pat terns, we are able to extract seasonal variations and long-term trends. 1 Introduction Analysis of rainfall data is important for many agricultural, ecological and engineering activities. Design of irrigation and drainage systems, for instance, needs to take account not only of mean expected rainfall, but also of rainfall volatility. In agricultural planning, changes in the annual cycle, e.g. advances in the onset of winter rain, are significant in determining the optimum time for planting crops. Estimates of crop yields also depend on the distribution of rainfall during the growing season, as well as on the overall amount.

The Storage Capacity,"We study the storage capacity of a fully-connected committee ma chine with a large number K of hidden nodes. The storage capac ity is obtained by analyzing the geometrical structure of the weight space related to the internal representation. By examining the as ymptotic behavior of order parameters in the limit of large K, the storage capacity is found to be proportional to ]{ Jln ]{ up to the Q c leading order. This result satisfies the mathematical bound given by Mitchison and Durbin, whereas the replica-symmetric solution in a conventional Gardner's approach violates this bound. 1 INTRODUCTION Since Gardner's pioneering work on the storage capacity of a single layer perceptron[1], there have been numerous efforts to use the statistical mechanics formulation to study feed-forward neural networks. The storage capacity of multi layer neural networks has been of particular interest, together with the general ization problem.

Structural Risk Minimization for,"The problem of time series prediction is studied within the uniform con vergence framework of Vapnik and Chervonenkis. The dependence in herent in the temporal structure is incorporated into the analysis, thereby generalizing the available theory for memoryless processes. Finite sam ple bounds are calculated in terms of covering numbers of the approxi mating class, and the tradeoff between approximation and estimation is discussed. A complexity regularization approach is outlined, based on Vapnik's method of Structural Risk Minimization, and shown to be ap plicable in the context of mixing stochastic processes. 1 Time Series Prediction and Mixing Processes A great deal of effort has been expended in recent years on the problem of deriving robust distribution-free error bounds for learning, mainly in the context of memory less processes (e.g. [9]).

Selecting weighting factors in logarithmic,"A simple linear averaging of the outputs of several networks as e.g. in bagging [3], seems to follow naturally from a bias/variance decomposition of the sum-squared error. The sum-squared error of the average model is a quadratic function of the weighting factors assigned to the networks in the ensemble [7], suggesting a quadratic programming algorithm for finding the ""optimal"" weighting factors. If we interpret the output of a network as a probability statement, the sum-squared error corresponds to minus the loglikelihood or the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and linear averaging of the out puts to logarithmic averaging of the probability statements: the logarithmic opinion pool. The crux of this paper is that this whole story about model aver aging, bias/variance decompositions, and quadratic programming to find the optimal weighting factors, is not specific for the sum squared error, but applies to the combination of probability state ments of any kind in a logarithmic opinion pool, a",Optimization & Theoretical ML,59f51fd6937412b7e56ded1ea2470c25-Paper.pdf,1997

This allows for the use of prior knowledge to reduce the search space and provides a framework in which knowledge can be transferred across problems and in which component solutions can be recombined to solve larger and more complicated problems. Our approach can be seen as providing a link between reinforcement learn ing and ""behavior-based"" or ""teleo-reactive"" approaches to control. We present provably convergent algorithms for problem-solving and learn ing with hierarchical machines and demonstrate their effectiveness on a problem with several thousand states. 1 Introduction Optimal decision making in virtually all spheres of human activity is rendered intractable by the complexity of the task environment.

Multiplicative Updating Rule,"For blind source separation, when the Fisher information matrix is used as the Riemannian metric tensor for the parameter space, the steepest descent algorithm to maximize the likelihood function in this Riemannian parameter space becomes the serial updating rule with equivariant property. This algorithm can be further simplified by using the asymptotic form of the Fisher information matrix around the equilibrium. 1 Introduction The relative gradient was introduced by (Cardoso and Laheld, 1996) to design multiplicative updating algorithms with equivariant property for blind separation problems. The idea is to calculate differentials by using a relative increment instead of an absolute increment in the parameter space. This idea has been extended to compute the relative Hessian by (Pham, 1996). For a matrix function f = f (W), the relative gradient is defined by ::V Vf= WT. (1) From the differential of f (W) based on the relative gradient, the following learning rule is given by (Cardos",Optimization & Theoretical ML,5e1b18c4c6a6d31695acbae3fd70ecc6-Paper.pdf,1997
On the Separation of Signals from,"We discuss a solution to the problem of separating waveforms pro duced by multiple cells in an extracellular neural recording. We take an explicitly probabilistic approach, using latent-variable mod els of varying sophistication to describe the distribution of wave forms produced by a single cell. The models range from a single Gaussian distribution of waveforms for each cell to a mixture of hidden Markov models. We stress the overall statistical structure of the approach, allowing the details of the generative model chosen to depend on the specific neural preparation. 1 INTRODUCTION Much of our empirical understanding of the systems-level functioning of the brain has come from a procedure called extracellular recording. The electrophysiologist inserts an insulated electrode with exposed tip into the extracellular space near one or more neuron cell bodies.

Task and Spatial Frequency Effects on Face,"There is strong evidence that face processing is localized in the brain. The double dissociation between prosopagnosia, a face recognition deficit occurring after brain damage, and visual object agnosia, difficulty recognizing otber kinds of complex objects, indicates tbat face and non face object recognition may be served by partially independent mecha nisms in the brain. Is neural specialization innate or learned? We sug gest that this specialization could be tbe result of a competitive learn ing mechanism that, during development, devotes neural resources to the tasks they are best at performing. Furtber, we suggest that the specializa tion arises as an interaction between task requirements and developmen tal constraints. In this paper, we present a feed-forward computational model of visual processing, in which two modules compete to classify input stimuli.

Extended leA Removes Artifacts from,"Severe contamination of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity by eye movements, blinks, muscle, heart and line noise is a serious problem for EEG interpretation and analysis. Rejecting contami nated EEG segments results in a considerable loss of information and may be impractical for clinical data. Many methods have been proposed to remove eye movement and blink artifacts from EEG recordings. Often regression in the time or frequency domain is performed on simultaneous EEG and electrooculographic (EOG) recordings to derive parameters characterizing the appearance and spread of EOG artifacts in the EEG channels. However, EOG records also contain brain signals [1, 2], so regressing out EOG ac tivity inevitably involves subtracting a portion of the relevant EEG signal from each recording as well. Regression cannot be used to remove muscle noise or line noise, since these have no reference channels. Here, we propose a new and generally applicable method for removing a wide variety of arti",Computer Vision,674bfc5f6b72706fb769f5e93667bd23-Paper.pdf,1997
Instabilities in Eye Movement Control: A Model,"Nystagmus is a pattern of eye movement characterized by smooth rota tions of the eye in one direction and rapid rotations in the opposite di rection that reset eye position. Periodic alternating nystagmus (PAN) is a form of uncontrollable nystagmus that has been described as an un stable but amplitude-limited oscillation. PAN has been observed previ ously only in subjects with vestibulo-cerebellar damage. We describe results in which PAN can be produced in normal subjects by prolonged rotation in darkness. We propose a new model in which the neural cir cuits that control eye movement are inherently unstable, but this insta bility is kept in check under normal circumstances by the cerebellum. Circumstances which alter this cerebellar restraint, such as vestibulo cerebellar damage or plasticity due to rotation in darkness, can lead to PAN. 1 INTRODUCTION Visual perception involves not only an operating visual sensory system, but also the abil ity to control eye movements.

This case arises in radio com munications with baseband signals. We incorporate known source signal distributions in the adaptation, thus making the algorithms less ""blind"". This results in drastic reduction of the amount of data needed for successful convergence. Adaptation to rapidly changing signal mixing conditions, such as to fading in mobile communica tions, becomes now feasible as demonstrated by simulations. 1 Introduction In SDMA (spatial division multiple access) the purpose is to separate radio signals of interfering users (either intentional or accidental) from each others on the basis of the spatial characteristics of the signals using smart antennas, array processing, and beamforming [5, 8).

Radial Basis Functions:,"Bayesian methods have been successfully applied to regression and classification problems in multi-layer perceptrons. We present a novel application of Bayesian techniques to Radial Basis Function networks by developing a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution which, for fixed basis function widths, is analytic in the parameters. The setting of regularization constants by cross validation is wasteful as only a single optimal parameter estimate is retained. We treat this issue by assigning prior distributions to these constants, which are then adapted in light of the data under a simple re-estimation formula. 1 Introduction Radial Basis Function networks are popular regression and classification tools[lO].

New Approximations of Differential,"We derive a first-order approximation of the density of maximum entropy for a continuous 1-D random variable, given a number of simple constraints. This results in a density expansion which is somewhat similar to the classical polynomial density expansions by Gram-Charlier and Edgeworth. Using this approximation of density, an approximation of 1-D differential entropy is derived. The approximation of entropy is both more exact and more ro bust against outliers than the classical approximation based on the polynomial density expansions, without being computationally more expensive. The approximation has applications, for example, in independent component analysis and projection pursuit. 1 Introduction The basic information-theoretic quantity for continuous one-dimensional random variables is differential entropy.

Synaptic Transmission: An,"Here we analyze synaptic transmission from an infonnation-theoretic perspective. We derive c1osed-fonn expressions for the lower-bounds on the capacity of a simple model of a cortical synapse under two explicit coding paradigms. Under the ""signal estimation"" paradigm, we assume the signal to be encoded in the mean firing rate of a Poisson neuron. The perfonnance of an optimal linear estimator of the signal then provides a lower bound on the capacity for signal estimation. Under the ""signal detection"" paradigm, the presence or absence of the signal has to be de tected.

The selection modules choose one appropriate control module dependent on the state. This hybrid learning sys tem was applied to the control of a stilt-type biped robot. It learned the control on a sloped floor more quickly than the usual reinforce ment learning because it did not need to learn the control on a flat floor, where the linear control module can control the robot.

With these ingredients we design a method for the classification of discrete sequences whenever they can be compressed. We introduce the method and illustrate its application for hierarchical clustering of languages and for estimating similarities of protein sequences. 1 Introd uction While the relationship between compression (minimal description) and supervised learning is by now well established, no such connection is generally accepted for the unsupervised case.

The result is a system that is capable of rapid navigation through a dense obstacle field. The key to the system is the use of zigzag behavior to articulate the body during movement. It is shown that this behavior compensates for a parallax blind spot surrounding the focus of expansion nor mally found in systems without parallax behavior.

Generalized Prioritized Sweeping,"Prioritized sweeping is a model-based reinforcement learning method that attempts to focus an agent's limited computational resources to achieve a good estimate of the value of environment states. To choose ef fectively where to spend a costly planning step, classic prioritized sweep ing uses a simple heuristic to focus computation on the states that are likely to have the largest errors. In this paper, we introduce generalized prioritized sweeping, a principled method for generating such estimates in a representation-specific manner. This allows us to extend prioritized sweeping beyond an explicit, state-based representation to deal with com pact representations that are necessary for dealing with large state spaces. We apply this method for generalized model approximators (such as Bayesian networks), and describe preliminary experiments that compare our approach with classical prioritized sweeping. 1 Introduction In reinforcement learning, there is a tradeoff between spending time ac",Reinforcement Learning,7b5b23f4aadf9513306bcd59afb6e4c9-Paper.pdf,1997
Multiresolution Tangent Distance for,"The ability to rely on similarity metrics invariant to image transforma tions is an important issue for image classification tasks such as face or character recognition. We analyze an invariant metric that has performed well for the latter - the tangent distance - and study its limitations when applied to regular images, showing that the most significant among these (convergence to local minima) can be drastically reduced by computing the distance in a multiresolution setting. This leads to the multi resolution tangent distance, which exhibits significantly higher invariance to im age transformations, and can be easily combined with robust estimation procedures. 1 Introduction Image classification algorithms often rely on distance metrics which are too sensitive to variations in the imaging environment or set up (e.g. the Euclidean and Hamming distances), or on metrics which, even though less sensitive to these variations, are application specific or too expensive from a computational ",Computer Vision,7d6044e95a16761171b130dcb476a43e-Paper.pdf,1997
Effects of Spike Timing Underlying,"In normal vision, the inputs from the two eyes are inte grated into a single percept. When dissimilar images are presented to the two eyes, however, perceptual integra tion gives way to alternation between monocular inputs, a phenomenon called binocular rivalry. Although recent evidence indicates that binocular rivalry involves a mod ulation of neuronal responses in extrastriate cortex, the basic mechanisms responsible for differential processing of con:6.icting and congruent stimuli remain unclear. Using a neural network that models the mammalian early visual system, I demonstrate here that the desynchronized fir ing of cortical-like neurons that first receive inputs from the two eyes results in rivalrous activity patterns at later stages in the visual pathway. By contrast, synchronization of firing among these cells prevents such competition.

Detection of first and second order motion,"A model of motion detection is presented. The model contains three stages. The first stage is unoriented and is selective for con trast polarities. The next two stages work in parallel. A phase insensitive stage pools across different contrast polarities through a spatiotemporal filter and thus can detect first and second order motion. A phase sensitive stage keeps contrast polarities separate, each of which is filtered through a spatiotemporal filter, and thus only first order motion can be detected. Differential phase sensitiv ity can therefore account for the detection of first and second order motion. Phase insensitive detectors correspond to cortical complex cells, and phase sensitive detectors to simple cells. 1 INTRODUCTION In our environment objects are constantly in motion, and the visual system faces the task of identifying the motion of objects.

A Framework for Multiple-Instance Learning,"Multiple-instance learning is a variation on supervised learning, where the task is to learn a concept given positive and negative bags of instances. Each bag may contain many instances, but a bag is labeled positive even if only one of the instances in it falls within the concept. A bag is labeled negative only if all the instances in it are negative. We describe a new general framework, called Diverse Density, for solving multiple-instance learning problems. We apply this framework to learn a simple description of a person from a series of images (bags) containing that person, to a stock selection problem, and to the drug activity prediction problem. 1 Introduction One ofthe drawbacks of applying the supervised learning model is that it is not always possible for a teacher to provide labeled examples for training.

We use distance functions of a certain kind in two completely independent roles in deriving and analyzing on-line learning algorithms for such tasks.

Gradients for retinotectal mapping,"The initial activity-independent formation of a topographic map in the retinotectal system has long been thought to rely on the matching of molecular cues expressed in gradients in the retina and the tectum.

Multi-modular Associative Memory,"Motivated by the findings of modular structure in the association cortex, we study a multi-modular model of associative memory that can successfully store memory patterns with different levels of ac tivity. We show that the segregation of synaptic conductances into intra-modular linear and inter-modular nonlinear ones considerably enhances the network's memory retrieval performance. Compared with the conventional, single-module associative memory network, the multi-modular network has two main advantages: It is less sus ceptible to damage to columnar input, and its response is consistent with the cognitive data pertaining to category specific impairment. 1 Introduction Cortical modules were observed in the somatosensory and visual cortices a few decades ago. These modules differ in their structure and functioning but are likely to be an elementary unit of processing in the mammalian cortex. Within each module the neurons are interconnected.

Analysis of Drifting Dynamics with,"We present a method for the analysis of nonstationary time se ries with multiple operating modes. In particular, it is possible to detect and to model both a switching of the dynamics and a less abrupt, time consuming drift from one mode to another. This is achieved in two steps. First, an unsupervised training method pro vides prediction experts for the inherent dynamical modes. Then, the trained experts are used in a hidden Markov model that allows to model drifts. An application to physiological wake/sleep data demonstrates that analysis and modeling of real-world time series can be improved when the drift paradigm is taken into account. 1 Introduction Modeling dynamical systems through a measured time series is commonly done by reconstructing the state space with time-delay coordinates [10]. The prediction of the time series can then be accomplished by training neural networks [11].

The Observer-Observation Dilemma,"We explain how the training data can be separated into clean informa tion and unexplainable noise. Analogous to the data, the neural network is separated into a time invariant structure used for forecasting, and a noisy part. We propose a unified theory connecting the optimization al gorithms for cleaning and learning together with algorithms that control the data noise and the parameter noise. The combined algorithm allows a data-driven local control of the liability of the network parameters and therefore an improvement in generalization. The approach is proven to be very useful at the task of forecasting the German bond market. 1 Introduction: The Observer-Observation Dilemma Human beings believe that they are able to solve a psychological version of the Observer Observation Dilemma. On the one hand, they use their observations to constitute an under standing of the laws of the world, on the other hand, they use this understanding to evaluate the correctness of the incoming pieces o",Optimization & Theoretical ML,86e8f7ab32cfd12577bc2619bc635690-Paper.pdf,1997
A Model of Early Visual Processing,"We propose a model for early visual processing in primates. The model consists of a population of linear spatial filters which inter act through non-linear excitatory and inhibitory pooling. Statisti cal estimation theory is then used to derive human psychophysical thresholds from the responses of the entire population of units. The model is able to reproduce human thresholds for contrast and ori entation discrimination tasks, and to predict contrast thresholds in the presence of masks of varying orientation and spatial frequency. 1 INTRODUCTION A remarkably wide range of human visual thresholds for spatial patterns appears to be determined by the earliest stages of visual processing, namely, orientation- and spatial frequency-tuned visual filters and their interactions [18, 19, 3, 22, 9]. Here we consider the possibility of quantitatively relating arbitrary spatial vision thresholds to a single computational model. The success of such a unified account should reveal the extent to whic",Computer Vision,8b0d268963dd0cfb808aac48a549829f-Paper.pdf,1997
A Simple and Fast Neural Network,"A neural network approach to stereovision is presented based on aliasing effects of simple disparity estimators and a fast coherence detection scheme. Within a single network structure, a dense dis parity map with an associated validation map and, additionally, the fused cyclopean view of the scene are available. The network operations are based on simple, biological plausible circuitry; the algorithm is fully parallel and non-iterative. 1 Introduction Humans experience the three-dimensional world not as it is seen by either their left or right eye, but from a position of a virtual cyclopean eye, located in the middle between the two real eye positions. The different perspectives between the left and right eyes cause slight relative displacements of objects in the two retinal images (disparities), which make a simple superposition of both images without diplopia impossible. Proper fusion of the retinal images into the cyclopean view requires the registration of both images to a common ",Computer Vision,8b0dc65f996f98fd178a9defd0efa077-Paper.pdf,1997
On Parallel Versus Serial Processing:,"A novel neural network model of pre-attention processing in visual search tasks is presented. Using displays of line orientations taken from Wolfe's experiments [1992], we study the hypothesis that the distinction between parallel versus serial processes arises from the availability of global information in the internal representations of the visual scene. The model operates in two phases. First, the visual displays are compressed via principal-component-analysis. Second, the compressed data is processed by a target detector mod ule in order to identify the existence of a target in the display. Our main finding is that targets in displays which were found exper imentally to be processed in parallel can be detected by the sys tem, while targets in experimentally-serial displays cannot. This fundamental difference is explained via variance analysis of the compressed representations, providing a numerical criterion distin guishing parallel from serial displays.

Using Expectation to Guide Processing:,"In many real world tasks, only a small fraction of the available inputs are important at any particular time. This paper presents a method for ascertaining the relevance of inputs by exploiting temporal coherence and predictability. The method pro posed in this paper dynamically allocates relevance to inputs by using expectations of their future values. As a model of the task is learned, the model is simulta neously extended to create task-specific predictions of the future values of inputs. Inputs which are either not relevant, and therefore not accounted for in the model, or those which contain noise, will not be predicted accurately. These inputs can be de-emphasized, and, in turn, a new, improved, model of the task created.

Features as Sufficient Statistics,"An image is often represented by a set of detected features. We get an enormous compression by representing images in this way. Fur thermore, we get a representation which is little affected by small amounts of noise in the image. However, features are typically chosen in an ad hoc manner. \Ve show how a good set of fea tures can be obtained using sufficient statistics. The idea of sparse data representation naturally arises. We treat the I-dimensional and 2-dimensional signal reconstruction problem to make our ideas concrete. 1 Introduction Consider an image, I, that is the result of a stochastic image-formation process. The process depends on the precise state, f, of an environment. The image, accordingly, contains information about the environmental state f, possibly corrupted by noise.

Factorizing Multivariate Function Classes,"The mathematical framework for factorizing equivalence classes of multivariate functions is formulated in this paper. Independent component analysis is shown to be a special case of this decompo sition. Using only the local geometric structure of a class repre sentative, we derive an analytic solution for the factorization. We demonstrate the factorization solution with numerical experiments and present a preliminary tie to decorrelation. 1 FORMALISM In independent component analysis (ICA), the goal is to find an unknown linear coordinate system where the joint distribution function admits a factorization into the product of one dimensional functions. However, this decomposition is only rarely possible. To formalize the notion of multivariate function factorization, we begin by defining an equivalence relation. Definition.

An Annealed Self-Organizing Map for Source,"We derive and analyse robust optimization schemes for noisy vector quantization on the basis of deterministic annealing. Starting from a cost function for central clustering that incorporates distortions from channel noise we develop a soft topographic vector quantization al gorithm (STVQ) which is based on the maximum entropy principle and which performs a maximum-likelihood estimate in an expectation maximization (EM) fashion. Annealing in the temperature parameter f3 leads to phase transitions in the existing code vector representation dur ing the cooling process for which we calculate critical temperatures and modes as a function of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the data and the transition matrix of the channel noise. A whole family of vector quantization algorithms is derived from STVQ, among them a deterministic annealing scheme for Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM).

How to Dynamically Merge Markov,"We are frequently called upon to perform multiple tasks that com pete for our attention and resource. Often we know the optimal solution to each task in isolation; in this paper, we describe how this knowledge can be exploited to efficiently find good solutions for doing the tasks in parallel. We formulate this problem as that of dynamically merging multiple Markov decision processes (MDPs) into a composite MDP, and present a new theoretically-sound dy namic programming algorithm for finding an optimal policy for the composite MDP. We analyze various aspects of our algorithm and illustrate its use on a simple merging problem. Every day, we are faced with the problem of doing mUltiple tasks in parallel, each of which competes for our attention and resource.

Refractoriness and Neural Precision,"The relationship between a neuron's refractory period and the precision of its response to identical stimuli was investigated. We constructed a model of a spiking neuron that combines probabilistic firing with a refractory period. For realistic refractoriness, the model closely reproduced both the average firing rate and the response precision of a retinal ganglion cell. The model is based on a ""free"" firing rate, which exists in the absence of refractoriness. This function may be a better description of a spiking neuron's response than the peri-stimulus time histogram. 1 INTRODUCTION The response of neurons to repeated stimuli is intrinsically noisy. In order to take this trial-to-trial variability into account, the response of a spiking neuron is often described by an instantaneous probability for generating an action potential. The response variability of such a model is determined by Poisson counting statistics; in particular, the variance in the spike count is equal to the mean sp",Optimization & Theoretical ML,95151403b0db4f75bfd8da0b393af853-Paper.pdf,1997

The pro posed active data sampling strategy is based on the expected value of information, a concept rooting in statistical decision theory.

Coding of Naturalistic Stimuli by,"It is known that humans can make finer discriminations between familiar sounds (e.g. syllables) than between unfamiliar ones (e.g. different noise segments). Here we show that a corresponding en hancement is present in early auditory processing stages. Based on previous work which demonstrated that natural sounds had robust statistical properties that could be quantified, we hypothesize that the auditory system exploits those properties to construct efficient neural codes. To test this hypothesis, we measure the informa tion rate carried by auditory spike trains on narrow-band stimuli whose amplitude modulation has naturalistic characteristics, and compare it to the information rate on stimuli with non-naturalistic modulation. We find that naturalistic inputs significantly enhance the rate of transmitted information, indicating that auditiory neu ral responses are matched to characteristics of natural auditory scenes. 1 Natural Scene Statistics and the Neural Code A primary goal of hea",NLP,9701a1c165dd9420816bfec5edd6c2b1-Paper.pdf,1997

After testing the new algorithm on real data, the possibility of risk management within the framework of Markov decision problems is analyzed. The proposed methods allows the construction of a multi-period portfolio management system which takes into account transaction costs, the risk preferences of the investor, and several constraints on the allocation. 1 Introduction Asset allocation and portfolio management deal with the distribution of capital to various investment opportunities like stocks, bonds, foreign exchanges and others.

Farah (1990) has proposed an alterna tive class of explanations involving partial damage to multiple path ways. We explore this explanation for optic aphasia, a disorder in which severe perfonnance deficits are observed when patients are asked to name visually presented objects, but surprisingly, performance is rela tively nonnal on naming objects from auditory cues and on gesturing the appropriate use of visually presented objects. We model this highly specific deficit through partial damage to two pathways-one that maps visual input to semantics, and the other that maps semantics to naming responses. The effect of this damage is superadditive, meaning that tasks which require one pathway or the other show little or no perfor mance deficit, but the damage is manifested when a task requires both pathways (i.e., naming visually presented objects).

The S-Map algorithm can be further simplified to employ pure Hebbian learning, with out changing the qualitative behaviour of the network. 1 Introduction The self-organizing map (SOM; for a review, see [1]) forms a topographic mapping from the data space onto a (usually two-dimensional) output space. The SOM has been succesfully used in a large number of applications [2]; nevertheless, there are some open theoretical questions, as discussed in [1, 3]. Most of these questions arise because of the following two facts: the SOM is not a generative model, i.e. it does not generate a density in the data space, and it does not have a well",Computer Vision,9a1756fd0c741126d7bbd4b692ccbd91-Paper.pdf,1997
Bayesian model of surface perception,"Image intensity variations can result from several different object surface effects, including shading from 3-dimensional relief of the object, or paint on the surface itself. An essential problem in vision, which people solve naturally, is to attribute the proper physical cause, e.g. surface relief or paint, to an observed image. We ad dressed this problem with an approach combining psychophysical and Bayesian computational methods. We assessed human performance on a set of test images, and found that people made fairly consistent judgements of surface properties. Our computational model assigned simple prior probabilities to different relief or paint explanations for an image, and solved for the most probable interpretation in a Bayesian framework. The ratings of the test images by our algorithm compared surprisingly well with the mean ratings of our subjects. 1 Introduction When people study a picture, they can judge whether it depicts a shaded, 3- dimensional surface, or simply a f",Computer Vision,9aa42b31882ec039965f3c4923ce901b-Paper.pdf,1997
Training Methods for Adaptive Boosting,"""Boosting"" is a general method for improving the performance of any learning algorithm that consistently generates classifiers which need to perform only slightly better than random guessing. A recently proposed and very promising boosting algorithm is AdaBoost [5].

The first stage of visual motion processing in flies is a retinotopic array of functional units known as el ementary motion detectors (EMDs).

The reason for using Bayesian learning for this task is two-fold. First, Bayesian inference is known to embody regularization automati cally.

Analytical study of the interplay between,"We study model feed forward networks as time series predictors in the stationary limit. The focus is on complex, yet non-chaotic, behavior. The main question we address is whether the asymptotic behavior is governed by the architecture, regardless the details of the weights. We find hierarchies among classes of architectures with respect to the attract or dimension of the long term sequence they are capable of generating; larger number of hidden units can generate higher dimensional attractors. In the case of a perceptron, we develop the stationary solution for general weights, and show that the flow is typically one dimensional. The relaxation time from an arbitrary initial condition to the stationary solution is found to scale linearly with the size of the network. In multilayer networks, the number of hidden units gives bounds on the number and dimension of the possible attractors.

We present a model, based largely on known features of hippocampal anatomy and physiology, that accounts for the following key character istics of recollection: 1) false recollection is rare (i.e., participants rarely claim to recollect having studied nonstudied items), and 2) increasing in terference leads to less recollection but apparently does not compromise the quality of recollection (i.e., the extent to which recollected infonna tion veridically reflects events that occurred at study). 1 Introduction For nearly 50 years, memory researchers have known that our ability to remember specific past episodes depends critically on th",Optimization & Theoretical ML,a60937eba57758ed45b6d3e91e8659f3-Paper.pdf,1997

Linear concepts and hidden variables:,"Some learning techniques for classification tasks work indirectly, by first trying to fit a full probabilistic model to the observed data. Whether this is a good idea or not depends on the robustness with respect to deviations from the postulated model. We study this question experimentally in a restricted, yet non-trivial and interesting case: we consider a conditionally independent attribute (CIA) model which postulates a single binary-valued hidden variable z on which all other attributes (i.e., the target and the observables) depend. In this model, finding the most likely value of anyone variable (given known values for the others) reduces to testing a linear function of the observed values. We learn CIA with two techniques: the standard EM algorithm, and a new algorithm we develop based on covariances.

Characterizing Neurons in the Primary,"While the understanding of the functional role of different classes of neurons in the awake primary visual cortex has been extensively studied since the time of Hubel and Wiesel (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962), our understanding of the feature selectivity and functional role of neurons in the primary auditory cortex is much farther from com plete.

Regression with Input-dependent Noise:,"Gaussian processes provide natural non-parametric prior distribu tions over regression functions. In this paper we consider regression problems where there is noise on the output, and the variance of the noise depends on the inputs. If we assume that the noise is a smooth function of the inputs, then it is natural to model the noise variance using a second Gaussian process, in addition to the Gaussian process governing the noise-free output value. We show that prior uncertainty about the parameters controlling both pro cesses can be handled and that the posterior distribution of the noise rate can be sampled from using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Our results on a synthetic data set give a posterior noise variance that well-approximates the true variance. 1 Background and Motivation A very natural approach to regression problems is to place a prior on the kinds of function that we expect, and then after observing the data to obtain a posterior.

On the infeasibility of training neural,"We demonstrate that the problem of training neural networks with small (average) squared error is computationally intractable.

Structure Driven Image Database,"A new algorithm is presented which approximates the perceived visual similarity between images. The images are initially trans formed into a feature space which captures visual structure, tex ture and color using a tree of filters. Similarity is the inverse of the distance in this perceptual feature space. Using this algorithm we have constructed an image database system which can perform example based retrieval on large image databases. Using carefully constructed target sets, which limit variation to only a single visual characteristic, retrieval rates are quantitatively compared to those of standard methods. 1 Introduction Without supplementary information, there exists no way to directly measure the similarity between the content of images. In general, one cannot answer a question of the form: ""is image A more like image B or image C?"" without defining the criteria by which this comparison is to be made.

Bayesian Robustification for Audio Visual,"We discuss the problem of catastrophic fusion in multimodal recog nition systems. This problem arises in systems that need to fuse different channels in non-stationary environments. Practice shows that when recognition modules within each modality are tested in contexts inconsistent with their assumptions, their influence on the fused product tends to increase, with catastrophic results. We ex plore a principled solution to this problem based upon Bayesian ideas of competitive models and inference robustification: each sensory channel is provided with simple white-noise context mod els, and the perceptual hypothesis and context are jointly esti mated. Consequently, context deviations are interpreted as changes in white noise contamination strength, automatically adjusting the influence of the module. The approach is tested on a fixed lexicon automatic audiovisual speech recognition problem with very good results. 1 Introduction In this paper we address the problem of catastrophic fusio",Computer Vision,b7087c1f4f89e63af8d46f3b20271153-Paper.pdf,1997
A Neural Network Model of Naive Preference,"Filial imprinting in domestic chicks is of interest in psychology, biology, and computational modeling because it exemplifies simple, rapid, in nately programmed learning which is biased toward learning about some objects. Hom et al. have recently discovered a naive visual preference for heads and necks which develops over the course of the first three days of life. The neurological basis of this predisposition is almost en tirely unknown; that of imprinting-related learning is fairly clear. This project is the first model of the predisposition consistent with what is known about learning in imprinting. The model develops the predisposi tion appropriately, learns to ""approach"" a training object, and replicates one interaction between the two processes. Future work will replicate more interactions between imprinting and the predisposition in chicks, and analyze why the system works. 1 Background Filial imprinting iIi domestic chicks is of interest in psychology, biology, and computation",Computer Vision,b8c27b7a1c450ffdacb31483454e0b54-Paper.pdf,1997
Shared Context Probabilistic Transducers,"Recently, a model for supervised learning of probabilistic transduc ers represented by suffix trees was introduced. However, this algo rithm tends to build very large trees, requiring very large amounts of computer memory. In this paper, we propose anew, more com pact, transducer model in which one shares the parameters of distri butions associated to contexts yielding similar conditional output distributions. We illustrate the advantages of the proposed algo rithm with comparative experiments on inducing a noun phrase recogmzer. 1 Introduction Learning algorithms for sequential data modeling are important in many applica tions such as natural language processing and time-series analysis, in which one has to learn a model from one or more sequences of training data.

Learning to Schedule Straight-Line Code,"Program execution speed on modem computers is sensitive, by a factor of two or more, to the order in which instructions are presented to the proces sor. To realize potential execution efficiency, an optimizing compiler must employ a heuristic algorithm for instruction scheduling. Such algorithms are painstakingly hand-crafted, which is expensive and time-consuming. We show how to cast the instruction scheduling problem as a learning task, ob taining the heuristic scheduling algorithm automatically. Our focus is the narrower problem of scheduling straight-line code (also called basic blocks of instructions). Our empirical results show that just a few features are ad equate for quite good performance at this task for a real modem processor, and that any of several supervised learning methods perform nearly opti mally with respect to the features used. 1 Introduction Modem computer architectures provide semantics of execution equivalent to sequential exe cution of instructions one at a ti",Optimization & Theoretical ML,bcc0d400288793e8bdcd7c19a8ac0c2b-Paper.pdf,1997
Approximating Posterior Distributions,"Exact inference in densely connected Bayesian networks is computation ally intractable, and so there is considerable interest in developing effec tive approximation schemes. One approach which has been adopted is to bound the log likelihood using a mean-field approximating distribution. While this leads to a tractable algorithm, the mean field distribution is as sumed to be factorial and hence unimodal. In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of using a richer class of approximating distributions based on mixtures of mean field distributions. We derive an efficient algorithm for updating the mixture parameters and apply it to the problem of learn ing in sigmoid belief networks. Our results demonstrate a systematic improvement over simple mean field theory as the number of mixture components is increased. 1 Introduction Bayesian belief networks can be regarded as a fully probabilistic interpretation of feed forward neural networks.

The Canonical Distortion Measure in Feature,"We prove that the Canonical Distortion Measure (CDM) [2, 3] is the optimal distance measure to use for I nearest-neighbour (l-NN) classifi cation, and show that it reduces to squared Euclidean distance in feature space for function classes that can be expressed as linear combinations of a fixed set of features. PAC-like bounds are given on the sample complexity required to learn the CDM.

A Non-parametric Multi-Scale Statistical,"The observed distribution of natural images is far from uniform. On the contrary, real images have complex and important struc ture that can be exploited for image processing, recognition and analysis. There have been many proposed approaches to the prin cipled statistical modeling of images, but each has been limited in either the complexity of the models or the complexity of the im ages. We present a non-parametric multi-scale statistical model for images that can be used for recognition, image de-noising, and in a ""generative mode"" to synthesize high quality textures. 1 Introduction In this paper we describe a multi-scale statistical model which can capture the structure of natural images across many scales. Once trained on example images, it can be used to recognize novel images, or to generate new images. Each of these tasks is reasonably efficient, requiring no more than a few seconds or minutes on a workstation.

A Solution for Missing Data in Recurrent Neural,"We consider neural network models for stochastic nonlinear dynamical systems where measurements of the variable of interest are only avail able at irregular intervals i.e. most realizations are missing. Difficulties arise since the solutions for prediction and maximum likelihood learn ing with missing data lead to complex integrals, which even for simple cases cannot be solved analytically. In this paper we propose a spe cific combination of a nonlinear recurrent neural predictive model and a linear error model which leads to tractable prediction and maximum likelihood adaptation rules. In particular, the recurrent neural network can be trained using the real-time recurrent learning rule and the linear error model can be trained by an EM adaptation rule, implemented us ing forward-backward Kalman filter equations.

Regularisation in Sequential Learning,"In this paper, we discuss regularisation in online/sequential learn ing algorithms. In environments where data arrives sequentially, techniques such as cross-validation to achieve regularisation or model selection are not possible. Further, bootstrapping to de termine a confidence level is not practical. To surmount these problems, a minimum variance estimation approach that makes use of the extended Kalman algorithm for training multi-layer percep trons is employed. The novel contribution of this paper is to show the theoretical links between extended Kalman filtering, Sutton's variable learning rate algorithms and Mackay's Bayesian estima tion framework. In doing so, we propose algorithms to overcome the need for heuristic choices of the initial conditions and noise covariance matrices in the Kalman approach. 1 INTRODUCTION Model estimation involves building mathematical representations of physical pro cesses using measured data.

An Improved Policy Iteratioll Algorithm,"A new policy iteration algorithm for partially observable Markov decision processes is presented that is simpler and more efficient than an earlier policy iteration algorithm of Sondik (1971,1978). The key simplification is representation of a policy as a finite-state controller. This representation makes policy evaluation straightforward. The pa per's contribution is to show that the dynamic-programming update used in the policy improvement step can be interpreted as the trans formation of a finite-state controller into an improved finite-state con troller. The new algorithm consistently outperforms value iteration as an approach to solving infinite-horizon problems. 1 Introduction A partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is a generalization of the standard completely observable Markov decision process that allows imperfect infor mation about the state of the system.

Learning Human-like Knowledge by Singular,"Singular value decomposition (SVD) can be viewed as a method for unsupervised training of a network that associates two classes of events reciprocally by linear connections through a single hidden layer. SVD was used to learn and represent relations among very large numbers of words (20k-60k) and very large numbers of natural text passages (lk- 70k) in which they occurred. The result was 100-350 dimensional ""semantic spaces"" in which any trained or newly aibl word or passage could be represented as a vector, and similarities were measured by the cosine of the contained angle between vectors. Good accmacy in simulating human judgments and behaviors has been demonstrated by performance on multiple-choice vocabulary and domain knowledge tests, emulation of expert essay evaluations, and in several other ways.

Modeling acoustic correlations by,"Hidden Markov models (HMMs) for automatic speech recognition rely on high dimensional feature vectors to summarize the short time properties of speech. Correlations between features can arise when the speech signal is non-stationary or corrupted by noise. We investigate how to model these correlations using factor analysis, a statistical method for dimensionality reduction. Factor analysis uses a small number of parameters to model the covariance struc ture of high dimensional data. These parameters are estimated by an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that can be em bedded in the training procedures for HMMs. We evaluate the combined use of mixture densities and factor analysis in HMMs that recognize alphanumeric strings.

Recovering Perspective Pose with a Dual,This paper describes a new approach to extracting 3D perspective structure from 2D point-sets.

Here we consider the problem of learning how to order, given feedback in the form of preference judgments, i.e., statements to the effect that one instance should be ranked ahead of another. We outline a two-stage approach in which one first learns by conventional means a preference Junction, of the form PREF( u, v), which indicates whether it is advisable to rank u before v. New instances are then ordered so as to maximize agreements with the learned preference func tion. We show that the problem of finding the ordering that agrees best with a preference function is NP-complete, even under very restrictive assumptions.

It aims to approximate the posterior distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler di vergence between the true posterior and a parametric approximat ing distribution. However, the derivation of a deterministic algo rithm relied on the use of a Gaussian approximating distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix and so was unable to capture the posterior correlations between parameters.

The model suggests how the theories of auditory perception and attention of Jones and Bregman may be reconciled. 1 Introduction Amplitude patterns of synchronized ""gamma band"" (30 to 80 Hz) oscillation have been ob s",Computer Vision,f0dd4a99fba6075a9494772b58f95280-Paper.pdf,1997
Combining Classifiers Using,"Several effective methods for improving the performance of a sin gle learning algorithm have been developed recently. The general approach is to create a set of learned models by repeatedly apply ing the algorithm to different versions of the training data, and then combine the learned models' predictions according to a pre scribed voting scheme. Little work has been done in combining the predictions of a collection of models generated by many learning algorithms having different representation and/or search strategies. This paper describes a method which uses the strategies of stack ing and correspondence analysis to model the relationship between the learning examples and the way in which they are classified by a collection of learned models. A nearest neighbor method is then applied within the resulting representation to classify previously unseen examples. The new algorithm consistently performs as well or better than other combining techniques on a suite of data sets. 1 Introducti",NLP,f016e59c7ad8b1d72903bb1aa5720d53-Paper.pdf,1997
From Regularization Operators,"We derive the correspondence between regularization operators used in Regularization Networks and Hilbert Schmidt Kernels appearing in Sup port Vector Machines. More specifica1ly, we prove that the Green's Func tions associated with regularization operators are suitable Support Vector Kernels with equivalent regularization properties. As a by-product we show that a large number of Radial Basis Functions namely condition ally positive definite functions may be used as Support Vector kernels. 1 INTRODUCTION Support Vector (SV) Machines for pattern recognition, regression estimation and operator inversion exploit the idea of transforming into a high dimensional feature space where they perform a linear algorithm. Instead of evaluating this map explicitly, one uses Hilbert Schmidt Kernels k(x, y) which correspond to dot products of the mapped data in high dimensional space, i.e. k(x, y) = (<I>(x) Â· <I>(y)) (I) with <I> : .!Rn --* :F denoting the map into feature space.

Two Approaches to Optimal Annealing,"We employ both master equation and order parameter approaches to analyze the asymptotic dynamics of on-line learning with dif ferent learning rate annealing schedules. We examine the relations between the results obtained by the two approaches and obtain new results on the optimal decay coefficients and their dependence on the number of hidden nodes in a two layer architecture. 1 Introduction The asymptotic dynamics of stochastic on-line learning and it's dependence on the annealing schedule adopted for the learning coefficients have been studied for some time in the stochastic approximation literature [1, 2] and more recently in the neural network literature [3, 4, 5]. The latter studies are based on examining the Kramers Moyal expansion of the master equation for the weight space probability densities.

Bidirectional Retrieval from Associative,"Similarity based fault tolerant retrieval in neural associative mem ories (N AM) has not lead to wiedespread applications. A draw back of the efficient Willshaw model for sparse patterns [Ste61, WBLH69], is that the high asymptotic information capacity is of little practical use because of high cross talk noise arising in the retrieval for finite sizes. Here a new bidirectional iterative retrieval method for the Willshaw model is presented, called crosswise bidi rectional (CB) retrieval, providing enhanced performance. We dis cuss its asymptotic capacity limit, analyze the first step, and com pare it in experiments with the Willshaw model. Applying the very efficient CB memory model either in information retrieval systems or as a functional model for reciprocal cortico-cortical pathways requires more than robustness against random noise in the input: Our experiments show also the segmentation ability of CB-retrieval with addresses containing the superposition of pattens, provided even ",Computer Vision,f52378e14237225a6f6c7d802dc6abbd-Paper.pdf,1997
Using Helmholtz Machines to analyze,"One of the current challenges to understanding neural information processing in biological systems is to decipher the ""code"" carried by large populations of neurons acting in parallel. We present an algorithm for automated discovery of stochastic firing patterns in large ensembles of neurons. The algorithm, from the ""Helmholtz Machine"" family, attempts to predict the observed spike patterns in the data. The model consists of an observable layer which is directly activated by the input spike patterns, and hidden units that are ac tivated through ascending connections from the input layer. The hidden unit activity can be propagated down to the observable layer to create a prediction of the data pattern that produced it. Hidden units are added incrementally and their weights are adjusted to im prove the fit between the predictions and data, that is, to increase a bound on the probability of the data given the model.

Silicon Retina with Adaptive Filtering,"This paper describes a small, compact circuit that captures the temporal and adaptation properties both of the photoreceptor and of the laminar layers of the fly. This circuit uses only six transis tors and two capacitors. It is operated in the subthreshold domain. The circuit maintains a high transient gain by using adaptation to the background intensity as a form of gain control. The adapta tion time constant of the circuit can be controlled via an external bias. Its temporal filtering properties change with the background intensity or signal-to-noise conditions. The frequency response of the circuit shows that in the frequency range of 1 to 100 Hz, the circuit response goes from highpass filtering under high light levels to lowpass filtering under low light levels (Le., when the signal-to noise ratio is low).

Statistical Models of Conditioning,"Conditioning experiments probe the ways that animals make pre dictions about rewards and punishments and use those predic tions to control their behavior. One standard model of condition ing paradigms which involve many conditioned stimuli suggests that individual predictions should be added together. Various key results show that this model fails in some circumstances, and mo tivate an alternative model, in which there is attentional selection between different available stimuli. The new model is a form of mixture of experts, has a close relationship with some other exist ing psychological suggestions, and is statistically well-founded. 1 Introduction Classical and instrumental conditioning experiments study the way that animals learn about the causal texture of the world (Dickinson, 1980) and use this informa tion to their advantage.

The Efficiency and The Robustness of,"The inverse of the Fisher information matrix is used in the natu ral gradient descent algorithm to train single-layer and multi-layer perceptrons. We have discovered a new scheme to represent the Fisher information matrix of a stochastic multi-layer perceptron. Based on this scheme, we have designed an algorithm to compute the natural gradient. When the input dimension n is much larger than the number of hidden neurons, the complexity of this algo rithm is of order O(n). It is confirmed by simulations that the natural gradient descent learning rule is not only efficient but also robust. 1 INTRODUCTION The inverse of the Fisher information matrix is required to find the Cramer-Rae lower bound to analyze the performance of an unbiased estimator. It is also needed in the natural gradient learning framework (Amari, 1997) to design statistically efficient algorithms for estimating parameters in general and for training neural networks in particular.

Computational Differences between,"Symmetrically connected recurrent networks have recently been used as models of a host of neural computations. However, be cause of the separation between excitation and inhibition, biolog ical neural networks are asymmetrical. We study characteristic differences between asymmetrical networks and their symmetri cal counterparts, showing that they have dramatically different dynamical behavior and also how the differences can be exploited for computational ends. We illustrate our results in the case of a network that is a selective amplifier. 1 Introduction A large class of non-linear recurrent networks, including those studied by Grossberg,9 the Hopfield net,lO,l1 and many more recent proposals for the head direction system,27 orientation tuning in primarls visual cortex,25, 1,3, 18 eye position,20 and spatial location in the hippocampus 9 make a key simplifying assumption that the connections between the neurons are symmetric.

A Randomized Algorithm for Pairwise Clustering,"We present a stochastic clustering algorithm based on pairwise sim ilarity of datapoints. Our method extends existing deterministic methods, including agglomerative algorithms, min-cut graph algo rithms, and connected components. Thus it provides a common framework for all these methods. Our graph-based method differs from existing stochastic methods which are based on analogy to physical systems. The stochastic nature of our method makes it more robust against noise, including accidental edges and small spurious clusters. We demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm using an example with 3 spiraling bands and a lot of noise. 1 Introduction Clustering algorithms can be divided into two categories: those that require a vec torial representation of the data, and those which use only pairwise representation. In the former case, every data item must be represented as a vector in a real normed space, while in the second case only pairwise relations of similarity or dissimilar ity are use",Optimization & Theoretical ML,06a81a4fb98d149f2d31c68828fa6eb2-Paper.pdf,1998
Learning a Continuous Hidden Variable,"A directed generative model for binary data using a small number of hidden continuous units is investigated. A clipping nonlinear ity distinguishes the model from conventional principal components analysis. The relationships between the correlations of the underly ing continuous Gaussian variables and the binary output variables are utilized to learn the appropriate weights of the network. The advantages of this approach are illustrated on a translationally in variant binary distribution and on handwritten digit images. Introduction Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique for rep resenting data with a large number of variables [1]. It is based upon the assumption that although the data is embedded in a high dimensional vector space, most of the variability in the data is captured by a much lower climensional manifold.

Convergence of The Wake-Sleep Algorithm,"The W-S (Wake-Sleep) algorithm is a simple learning rule for the models with hidden variables. It is shown that this algorithm can be applied to a factor analysis model which is a linear version of the Helmholtz ma chine. But even for a factor analysis model, the general convergence is not proved theoretically. In this article, we describe the geometrical un derstanding of the W-S algorithm in contrast with the EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm and the em algorithm. As the result, we prove the convergence of the W-S algorithm for the factor analysis model. We also show the condition for the convergence in general models. 1 INTRODUCTION The W-S algorithm[5] is a simple Hebbian learning algorithm. Neal and Dayan applied the W-S algorithm to a factor analysis mode1[7]. This model can be seen as a linear version of the Helmholtz machine[3].

Call-based Fraud Detection in Mobile,Fraud causes substantial losses to telecommunication carriers. Detec tion systems which automatically detect illegal use of the network can be used to alleviate the problem. Previous approaches worked on features derived from the call patterns of individual users. In this paper we present a call-based detection system based on a hierarchical regime-switching model. The detection problem is formulated as an inference problem on the regime probabilities. Inference is implemented by applying the junc tion tree algorithm to the underlying graphical model. The dynamics are learned from data using the EM algorithm and subsequent discriminative training. The methods are assessed using fraud data from a real mobile communication network. 1 INTRODUCTION Fraud is costly to a network carrier both in terms of lost income and wasted capacity.

Learning Nonlinear Dynamical Systems,"The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative pro cedure for maximum likelihood parameter estimation from data sets with missing or hidden variables [2]. It has been applied to system identification in linear stochastic state-space models, where the state variables are hidden from the observer and both the state and the parameters of the model have to be estimated simulta neously [9]. We present a generalization of the EM algorithm for parameter estimation in nonlinear dynamical systems. The ""expec tation"" step makes use of Extended Kalman Smoothing to estimate the state, while the ""maximization"" step re-estimates the parame ters using these uncertain state estimates.

Analyzing and Visualizing Single-Trial,"Event-related potentials (ERPs), are portions of electroencephalo graphic (EEG) recordings that are both time- and phase-locked to experimental events. ERPs are usually averaged to increase their signal/noise ratio relative to non-phase locked EEG activ ity, regardless of the fact that response activity in single epochs may vary widely in time course and scalp distribution. This study applies a linear decomposition tool, Independent Component Anal ysis (ICA) [1], to multichannel single-trial EEG records to derive spatial filters that decompose single-trial EEG epochs into a sum of temporally independent and spatially fixed components arising from distinct or overlapping brain or extra-brain networks.

"Replicator Equations, Maximal Cliques,","We present a new energy-minimization framework for the graph isomorphism problem which is based on an equivalent maximum clique formulation.

"Orientation, Scale, and Discontinuity as","A recent neural model of illusory contour formation is based on a distribution of natural shapes traced by particles moving with constant speed in directions given by Brownian motions. The input to that model consists of pairs of position and direction constraints and the output consists of the distribution of contours joining all such pairs. In general, these contours will not be closed and their distribution will not be scale-invariant. In this paper, we show how to compute a scale-invariant distribution of closed contours given position constraints alone and use this result to explain a well known illusory contour effect. 1 INTRODUCTION It has been proposed by Mumford[3] that the distribution of illusory contour shapes can be modeled by particles travelling with constant speed in directions given by Brownian motions. More recently, Williams and Jacobs[7, 8] introduced the notion of a stochastic completion field, the distribution of particle trajectories joining pairs of position and",Computer Vision,109d2dd3608f669ca17920c511c2a41e-Paper.pdf,1998

Coordinate Transformation Learning of,"In order to grasp an object, we need to solve the inverse kine matics problem, i.e., the coordinate transformation from the visual coordinates to the joint angle vector coordinates of the arm. Al though several models of coordinate transformation learning have been proposed, they suffer from a number of drawbacks. In human motion control, the learning of the hand position error feedback controller in the inverse kinematics solver is important. This paper proposes a novel model of the coordinate transformation learning of the human visual feedback controller that uses the change of the joint angle vector and the corresponding change of the square of the hand position error norm.

Multi-electrode spike sorting,"A new paradigm is proposed for sorting spikes in multi-electrode data using ratios of transfer functions between cells and electrodes. It is assumed that for every cell and electrode there is a stable linear relation. These are dictated by the properties of the tissue, the electrodes and their relative geometries. The main advantage of the method is that it is insensitive to variations in the shape and amplitude of a spike. Spike sorting is carried out in two separate steps. First, templates describing the statistics of each spike type are generated by clustering transfer function ratios then spikes are detected in the data using the spike statistics. These techniques were applied to data generated in the escape response system of the cockroach. 1 Introduction Simultaneous recording of activity from many neurons can greatly expand our un derstanding of how information is coded in neural systems[l]. 11ultiple electrodes are often used to measure the activity in neural tissue and have be",Computer Vision,1714726c817af50457d810aae9d27a2e-Paper.pdf,1998
Fisher Scoring and a Mixture of Modes,"We present Monte-Carlo generalized EM equations for learning in non linear state space models. The difficulties lie in the Monte-Carlo E-step which consists of sampling from the posterior distribution of the hidden variables given the observations. The new idea presented in this paper is to generate samples from a Gaussian approximation to the true posterior from which it is easy to obtain independent samples. The parameters of the Gaussian approximation are either derived from the extended Kalman filter or the Fisher scoring algorithm. In case the posterior density is mul timodal we propose to approximate the posterior by a sum of Gaussians (mixture of modes approach).

Probabilistic Modeling for Face Orientation,"This paper presents probabilistic modeling methods to solve the problem of dis criminating between five facial orientations with very little labeled data. Three models are explored. The first model maintains no inter-pixel dependencies, the second model is capable of modeling a set of arbitrary pair-wise dependencies, and the last model allows dependencies only between neighboring pixels. We show that for all three of these models, the accuracy of the learned models can be greatly improved by augmenting a small number of labeled training images with a large set of unlabeled images using Expectation-Maximization. This is important because it is often difficult to obtain image labels, while many unla beled images are readily available. Through a large set of empirical tests, we examine the benefits of unlabeled data for each of the models. By using only two randomly selected labeled examples per class, we can discriminate between the five facial orientations with an accuracy of 94%; with",Computer Vision,18d10dc6e666eab6de9215ae5b3d54df-Paper.pdf,1998

In the absence of the Markov property, popular reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-Iearning may no longer be effective, and memory-based methods which remove partial observability via state-estimation are notoriously expensive.

In many cases, computational accuracy is not as important as computational speed. In feature extraction, for instance, the features of interest in a signal are usually quite distorted. This form of noise justifies some level of quantization in order to achieve faster feature extraction. Our approach consists of approximating regions of the signal with low degree polynomi als, and then differentiating the resulting signals in order to obtain impulse functions (or derivatives of impulse functions). With this representation, convolution becomes extremely simple and can be implemented quite effectively. The true convolution can be recov ered by integrating the result of the convolution.

Our model - calibrated by an automatic fitting procedure - simultaneously re produces thresholds for four classical pattern discrimination tasks, performed while attention was engaged by another concurrent task. Our model then predicts that the seemingly complex improvements of certain thresholds, which we observed when attention was fully available for the discrimination tasks, can best be explained by a strengthening of competition among early visual filters. 1 INTRODUCTION What happens when we voluntarily focus our attention to a restricted part of our visual field?

The noise sources we consider are thermal noise, channel noise arising from the stochastic nature of voltage-dependent ionic channels (K+ and Na+) and synaptic noise due to spontaneous background activity. We assess the efficacy of information transfer using a signal detection paradigm where the objective is to detect the presence/absence of a presynaptic spike from the post-synaptic membrane voltage. This allows us to analytically assess the role of each of these noise sources in information transfer.

In the case of mixture models, non-global maxima often involve having too many components of a mixture model in one part of the space and too few in an other, widely separated part of the space. To escape from such configurations we repeatedly perform simultaneous split and merge operations using a new criterion for efficiently selecting the split and merge candidates. We apply the proposed algorithm to the training of Gaussian mixtures and mixtures of factor analyzers using synthetic and real data and show the effectiveness of using the split and merge operations to improve the likelihood of both the training data and of held-out test data. 1 INTRODUCTION Mixture density models, in particular normal mixtures, have been extensively used in the field of statistical pattern recognition [1].

Learning Lie Groups for Invariant Visual Perception*,"One of the most important problems in visual perception is that of visual in variance: how are objects perceived to be the same despite undergoing transfor mations such as translations, rotations or scaling? In this paper, we describe a Bayesian method for learning invariances based on Lie group theory. We show that previous approaches based on first-order Taylor series expansions of inputs can be regarded as special cases of the Lie group approach, the latter being ca pable of handling in principle arbitrarily large transfonnations. Using a matrix exponential based generative model of images, we derive an unsupervised al gorithm for learning Lie group operators from input data containing infinites imal transfonnations. The on-line unsupervised learning algorithm maximizes the posterior probability of generating the training data. We provide experimen tal results suggesting that the proposed method can learn Lie group operators for handling reasonably large I-D translations and 2-D rot",Computer Vision,277281aada22045c03945dcb2ca6f2ec-Paper.pdf,1998
Tractable Variational Structures for,"Graphical models provide a broad probabilistic framework with ap plications in speech recognition (Hidden Markov Models), medical diagnosis (Belief networks) and artificial intelligence (Boltzmann Machines). However, the computing time is typically exponential in the number of nodes in the graph. Within the variational frame work for approximating these models, we present two classes of dis tributions, decimatable Boltzmann Machines and Tractable Belief Networks that go beyond the standard factorized approach. We give generalised mean-field equations for both these directed and undirected approximations. Simulation results on a small bench mark problem suggest using these richer approximations compares favorably against others previously reported in the literature. 1 Introduction Graphical models provide a powerful framework for probabilistic inference[l] but suffer intractability when applied to large scale problems.

The chip processes and vector-quantises 30 dimen sional analogue vectors while consuming a maximum of 2.5 J-tW power for a heart rate of 60 beats per minute (1 vector per second) from a 3.3 V supply. This represents a significant advance on previous work which achieved ultra low power supervised morphology classification since the template matching scheme used in this chip enables unsupervised blind classification of abnonnal rhythms and the computational support for low bit rate data compression.

Learning to Find Pictures of People,"Finding articulated objects, like people, in pictures present.s a par ticularly difficult object. recognition problem. We show how t.o find people by finding putative body segments, and then construct. ing assemblies of those segments that are consist.ent with the con straints on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable model of a person requires at. least nine segments, it is not possible to present every group to a classi fier. Instead, the search can be pruned by using projected versions of a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient projection algorithm for one popular classi fier, and demonstrate that our approach can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people. 1 Introduction Several t.ypical collpctions containing over ten million images are listed in [2].

In particular, probabilistic descriptions of the group structure, essential to capture inter-cluster relation ships, are hardly assessable by simple inspection ofthe probabilistic assignment variables. VVe present a novel approach to the visual ization of group structure. It is based on a statistical model of the object assignments which have been observed or estimated by a probabilistic clustering procedure.

Modeling Surround Suppression in VI Neurons,"We examine the statistics of natural monochromatic images decomposed using a multi-scale wavelet basis. Although the coefficients of this rep resentation are nearly decorrelated, they exhibit important higher-order statistical dependencies that cannot be eliminated with purely linear pro c~ssing. In particular, rectified coefficients corresponding to basis func tions at neighboring spatial positions, orientations and scales are highly correlated. A method of removing these dependencies is to divide each coefficient by a weighted combination of its rectified neighbors. Sev eral successful models of the steady -state behavior of neurons in primary visual cortex are based on such ""divisive normalization"" computations, and thus our analysis provides a theoretical justification for these models. Perhaps more importantly, the statistical measurements explicitly specify the weights that should be used in computing the normalization signal.

Graphical Models for Recognizing,"We describe a real-time computer vision and machine learning sys tem for modeling and recognizing human actions and interactions. Two different domains are explored: recognition of two-handed motions in the martial art 'Tai Chi', and multiple-person interac tions in a visual surveillance task. Our system combines top-down with bottom-up information using a feedback loop, and is formu lated with a Bayesian framework. Two different graphical models (HMMs and Coupled HMMs) are used for modeling both individual actions and multiple-agent interactions, and CHMMs are shown to work more efficiently and accurately for a given amount of train ing. Finally, to overcome the limited amounts of training data, we demonstrate that 'synthetic agents' (Alife-style agents) can be used to develop flexible prior models of the person-to-person inter actions. 1 INTRODUCTION We describe a real-time computer vision and machine learning system for modeling and recognizing human behaviors in two different scena",Computer Vision,3a20f62a0af1aa152670bab3c602feed-Paper.pdf,1998
An entropic estimator for structure discovery,"We introduce a novel framework for simultaneous structure and parameter learning in hidden-variable conditional probability models, based on an en tropic prior and a solution for its maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. The MAP estimate minimizes uncertainty in all respects: cross-entropy between model and data; entropy of the model; entropy of the data's descriptive statistics. Iterative estimation extinguishes weakly supported parameters, compressing and sparsifying the model. Trimming operators accelerate this process by removing excess parameters and, unlike most pruning schemes, guarantee an increase in posterior probability. Entropic estimation takes a overcomplete random model and simplifies it, inducing the structure of relations between hidden and observed variables. Applied to hidden Markov models (HMMs), it finds a concise finite-state machine representing the hidden structure of a signal. We entropically model music, handwriting, and video time-series, and show that the re",Optimization & Theoretical ML,3fb451ca2e89b3a13095b059d8705b15-Paper.pdf,1998
The Effect of Correlations on the Fisher,"We study the effect of correlated noise on the accuracy of popu lation coding using a model of a population of neurons that are broadly tuned to an angle in two-dimension. The fluctuations in the neuronal activity is modeled as a Gaussian noise with pairwise correlations which decays exponentially with the difference between the preferred orientations of the pair. By calculating the Fisher in formation of the system, we show that in the biologically relevant regime of parameters positive correlations decrease the estimation capability of the network relative to the uncorrelated population. Moreover strong positive correlations result in information capac ity which saturates to a finite value as the number of cells in the population grows. In contrast, negative correlations substantially increase the information capacity of the neuronal population. 1 Introduction In many neural systems, information regarding sensory inputs or (intended) motor outputs is found to be distributed throughou",Computer Vision,41a60377ba920919939d83326ebee5a1-Paper.pdf,1998
Spike-Based Compared to Rate-Based,"A correlation-based learning rule at the spike level is formulated, mathematically analyzed, and compared to learning in a firing-rate description. A differential equation for the learning dynamics is derived under the assumption that the time scales of learning and spiking can be separated. For a linear Poissonian neuron model which receives time-dependent stochastic input we show that spike correlations on a millisecond time scale play indeed a role. Corre lations between input and output spikes tend to stabilize structure formation, provided that the form of the learning window is in accordance with Hebb's principle. Conditions for an intrinsic nor malization of the average synaptic weight are discussed. 1 Introduction Most learning rules are formulated in terms of mean firing rates, viz., a continuous variable reflecting the mean activity of a neuron.

Contrast adaptation in simple cells by changing,"The contrast response function (CRF) of many neurons in the primary vi sual cortex saturates and shifts towards higher contrast values following prolonged presentation of high contrast visual stimuli. Using a recurrent neural network of excitatory spiking neurons with adapting synapses we show that both effects could be explained by a fast and a slow compo nent in the synaptic adaptation. (i) Fast synaptic depression leads to sat uration of the CRF and phase advance in the cortical response to high contrast stimuli. (ii) Slow adaptation of the synaptic transmitter release probability is derived such that the mutual information between the input and the output of a cortical neuron is maximal.

Information Maximization in Single Neurons,"Information from the senses must be compressed into the limited range of firing rates generated by spiking nerve cells. Optimal compression uses all firing rates equally often, implying that the nerve cell's response matches the statistics of naturally occurring stimuli. Since changing the voltage-dependent ionic conductances in the cell membrane alters the flow of information, an unsupervised, non-Hebbian, developmental learning rule is derived to adapt the conductances in Hodgkin-Huxley model neurons. By maximizing the rate of information transmission, each firing rate within the model neuron's limited dynamic range is used equally often. An efficient neuronal representation of incoming sensory information should take advan tage of the regularity and scale invariance of stimulus features in the natural world. In the case of vision, this regularity is reflected in the typical probabilities of encountering particular visual contrasts, spatial orientations, or colors [1].

Here we demonstrate generalization using a novel paradigm in motion discrimination where learning has been previ ously shown to be specific. We trained subjects to discriminate the directions of moving dots, and verified the previous results that learning does not transfer from the trained direction to a new one. However, by tracking the subjects' performance across time in the new direction, we found that their rate of learning doubled. Therefore, learning generalized in a task previously considered too difficult for generalization. We also replicated, in the second ex periment, transfer following training with ""easy"" stimuli.

Probabilistic Image Sensor Fusion,"We present a probabilistic method for fusion of images produced by multiple sensors.

A Bayesian framework then provides for maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimates of the true scene from the sensor images. Maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the image formation model involve (local) second order image statistics, and thus are related to local principal component analysis. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on images from visible-band and infrared sensors. 1 Introduction Advances in sensing devices have fueled the deployment of multiple sensors in several computational vision systems [1, for example].

Furthermore, we show how to choose the optimal sparse coding basis for denoising.

The centroid localization circuit uses time-windowed asynchronously triggered row and column address events and two linear resistive grids to provide the analog coordinates of the motion centroid. This VLSI chip is used to realize fast lightweight autonavigating vehicles. The obstacle avoiding line-following algorithm is discussed. 1 INTRODUCTION Many neuromorphic chips which mimic the analog and parallel characteristics of visual, auditory and cortical neural circuits have been designed [Mead, 1989; Koch, 1995]. Recently researchers have started to combine digital circuits with neuromorphic aVLSI systems [Boahen, 1996]. The persistent doctrine, however, has been that computation should be performed in analog, ",Computer Vision,6490791e7abf6b29a381288cc23a8223-Paper.pdf,1998
Discontinuous Recall Transitions Induced By,"We present exact analytical equilibrium solutions for a class of recur rent neural network models, with both sequential and parallel neuronal dynamics, in which there is a tunable competition between nearest neighbour and long-range synaptic interactions. This competition is found to induce novel coexistence phenomena as well as discontinuous transitions between pattern recall states, 2-cycles and non-recall states. 1 INTRODUCTION Analytically solvable models of large recurrent neural networks are bound to be simplified representations of biological reality. In early analytical studies such as [1,2] neurons were, for instance, only allowed to interact with a strength which was independent of their spatial distance (these are the so-called mean field models). At present both the statics of infinitely large mean-field models of recurrent networks, as well as their dynamics away from satura tion are well understood, and have obtained the status of textbook or review paper material [3,4].

An Integrated Vision Sensor for the,"A robust, integrative algorithm is presented for computing the position of the focus of expansion or axis of rotation (the singular point) in optical flow fields such as those generated by self-motion. Measurements are shown of a fully parallel CMOS analog VLSI motion sensor array which computes the direction of local motion (sign of optical flow) at each pixel and can directly implement this algorithm. The flow field singular point is computed in real time with a power consumption of less than 2 m W. Computation of the singular point for more general flow fields requires measures of field expansion and rotation, which it is shown can also be computed in real-time hardware, again using only the sign of the optical flow field. These measures, along with the location of the singular point, provide robust real-time self-motion information for the visual guidance of a moving platform such as a robot. 1 INTRODUCTION Visually guided navigation of autonomous vehicles requires robust measures ",Computer Vision,69d658d0b2859e32cd4dc3b970c8496c-Paper.pdf,1998
"Robust. Efficient, Globally-Optimized","Parti-game (Moore 1994a; Moore 1994b; Moore and Atkeson 1995) is a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that has a lot of promise in over coming the curse of dimensionality that can plague RL algorithms when applied to high-dimensional problems. In this paper we introduce mod ifications to the algorithm that further improve its performance and ro bustness. In addition, while parti-game solutions can be improved locally by standard local path-improvement techniques, we introduce an add-on algorithm in the same spirit as parti-game that instead tries to improve solutions in a non-local manner. 1 INTRODUCTION Parti-game operates on goal problems by dynamically partitioning the space into hyper rectangular cells of varying sizes, represented using a k-d tree data structure. It assumes the existence of a pre-specified local controller that can be commanded to proceed from the current state to a given state.

Learning a Hierarchical Belief Network of,"Many belief networks have been proposed that are composed of binary units. However, for tasks such as object and speech recog nition which produce real-valued data, binary network models are usually inadequate. Independent component analysis (ICA) learns a model from real data, but the descriptive power of this model is severly limited. We begin by describing the independent factor analysis (IFA) technique, which overcomes some of the limitations of ICA. We then create a multilayer network by cascading single layer IFA models. At each level, the IFA network extracts real valued latent variables that are non-linear functions of the input data with a highly adaptive functional form, resulting in a hier archical distributed representation of these data. Whereas exact maximum-likelihood learning of the network is intractable, we de rive an algorithm that maximizes a lower bound on the likelihood, based on a variational approach. 1 Introduction An intriguing hypothesis for how the brain rep",Computer Vision,6ba3af5d7b2790e73f0de32e5c8c1798-Paper.pdf,1998
A Reinforcement Learning Algorithm,"We describe a Reinforcement Learning algorithm for partially observ able environments using short-term memory, which we call BLHT. Since BLHT learns a stochastic model based on Bayesian Learning, the over fitting problem is reasonably solved. Moreover, BLHT has an efficient implementation. This paper shows that the model learned by BLHT con verges to one which provides the most accurate predictions of percepts and rewards, given short-term memory. 1 INTRODUCTION Research on Reinforcement Learning (RL) prob model-free lem for partially observable environments is gain ing more attention recently. This is mainly because the assumption that perfect and complete perception of the state of the environment is available for the learning agent, which many previous RL algorithms Figure I: Three approaches require, is not valid for many realistic environments. One of the approaches to the problem is the model-free approach (Singh et al. 1995; Jaakkola et al. 1995) (arrow a in the Fig.l) which giv",Reinforcement Learning,6d3a1e06d6a06349436bc054313b648c-Paper.pdf,1998
Semiparametric Support Vector and,"Semiparametric models are useful tools in the case where domain knowledge exists about the function to be estimated or emphasis is put onto understandability of the model. We extend two learning algorithms - Support Vector machines and Linear Programming machines to this case and give experimental results for SV ma chines. 1 Introduction One of the strengths of Support Vector (SV) machines is that they are nonparamet ric techniques, where one does not have to e.g. specify the number of basis functions beforehand. In fact, for many of the kernels used (not the polynomial kernels) like Gaussian rbf-kernels it can be shown [6] that SV machines are universal approxi mators. While this is advantageous in general, parametric models are useful techniques in their own right. Especially if one happens to have additional knowledge about the problem, it would be unwise not to take advantage of it. For instance it might be the case that the major properties of the data are described by a combinati",Optimization & Theoretical ML,70efba66d3d8d53194fb1a8446ae07fa-Paper.pdf,1998
Maximum-Likelihood Continuity Mapping,"We describe Maximum-Likelihood Continuity Mapping (MALCOM), an alternative to hidden Markov models (HMMs) for processing sequence data such as speech. While HMMs have a discrete ""hidden"" space con strained by a fixed finite-automaton architecture, MALCOM has a con tinuous hidden space-a continuity map-that is constrained only by a smoothness requirement on paths through the space. MALCOM fits into the same probabilistic framework for speech recognition as HMMs, but it represents a more realistic model of the speech production process. To evaluate the extent to which MALCOM captures speech production information, we generated continuous speech continuity maps for three speakers and used the paths through them to predict measured speech articulator data. The median correlation between the MALCOM paths obtained from only the speech acoustics and articulator measurements was 0.77 on an independent test set not used to train MALCOM or the predictor.

Regularizing AdaBoost,"Boosting methods maximize a hard classification margin and are known as powerful techniques that do not exhibit overfitting for low noise cases. Also for noisy data boosting will try to enforce a hard margin and thereby give too much weight to outliers, which then leads to the dilemma of non-smooth fits and overfitting. Therefore we propose three algorithms to allow for soft margin classification by introducing regularization with slack variables into the boosting concept: (1) AdaBoost and regularized versions of (2) linear reg and (3) quadratic programming AdaBoost. Experiments show the usefulness of the proposed algorithms in comparison to another soft margin classifier: the support vector machine. 1 Introd uction Boosting and other ensemble methods have been used with success in several ap plications, e.g. OCR [13, 8]. For low noise cases several lines of explanation have been proposed as candidates for explaining the well functioning of boosting meth ods.

The Bias-Variance Tradeoff and the Randomized,"We propose a new in-sample cross validation based method (randomized GACV) for choosing smoothing or bandwidth parameters that govern the bias-variance or fit-complexity tradeoff in 'soft' classification. Soft clas sification refers to a learning procedure which estimates the probability that an example with a given attribute vector is in class 1 vs class O. The target for optimizing the the tradeoff is the Kullback-Liebler distance between the estimated probability distribution and the 'true' probabil ity distribution, representing knowledge of an infinite population. The method uses a randomized estimate of the trace of a Hessian and mimics cross validation at the cost of a single relearning with perturbed outcome data. 1 INTRODUCTION We propose and test a new in-sample cross-validation based method for optimizing the bias variance tradeoff in 'soft classification' (Wahba et al1994), called ranG ACV (randomized Generalized Approximate Cross Validation).

Adding Constrained Discontinuities to Gaussian,"Gaussian Processes provide good prior models for spatial data, but can be too smooth. In many physical situations there are discontinuities along bounding surfaces, for example fronts in near-surface wind fields. We describe a modelling method for such a constrained discontinuity and demonstrate how to infer the model parameters in wind fields with MCMC sampling. 1 INTRODUCTION We introduce a model for wind fields based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) with 'constrained discontinuities'. GPs provide a flexible framework for modelling various systems. They have been adopted in the neural network community and are interpreted as placing priors over functions. Stationary vector-valued GP models (Daley, 1991) can produce realistic wind fields when run as a generative model; however, the resulting wind fields do not contain some features typical of the atmosphere. The most difficult features to include are surface fronts. Fronts are generated by complex atmospheric dynamics and are marked by lar",Optimization & Theoretical ML,77f959f119f4fb2321e9ce801e2f5163-Paper.pdf,1998
DTs: Dynamic Trees,"In this paper we introduce a new class of image models, which we call dynamic trees or DTs. A dynamic tree model specifies a prior over a large number of trees, each one of which is a tree-structured belief net (TSBN). Experiments show that DTs are capable of generating images that are less blocky, and the models have better translation invariance properties than a fixed, ""balanced"" TSBN. We also show that Simulated Annealing is effective at finding trees which have high posterior probability. 1 Introduction In this paper we introduce a new class of image models, which we call dynamic trees or DTs. A dynamic tree model specifies a prior over a large number of trees, each one of which is a tree-structured belief net (TSBN).

Synergy and redundancy among brain,"Determining the relationship between the activity of a single nerve cell to that of an entire population is a fundamental question that bears on the basic neural computation paradigms. In this paper we apply an information theoretic approach to quantify the level of cooperative activity among cells in a behavioral context. It is possible to discriminate between synergetic activity of the cells vs. redundant activity, depending on the difference between the infor mation they provide when measured jointly and the information they provide independently. We define a synergy value that is pos itive in the first case and negative in the second and show that the synergy value can be measured by detecting the behavioral mode of the animal from simultaneously recorded activity of the cells. We observe that among cortical cells positive synergy can be found, while cells from the basal ganglia, active during the same task, do not exhibit similar synergetic activity. titay,tishby}@cs.huji.ac.il Pe",NLP,7a6a74cbe87bc60030a4bd041dd47b78-Paper.pdf,1998
The Belief in TAP,"We show the similarity between belief propagation and TAP, for decoding corrupted messages encoded by Sourlas's method. The latter is a special case of the Gallager error-correcting code, where the code word comprises products of J{ bits selected randomly from the original message. We examine the efficacy of solutions obtained by the two methods for various values of J{ and show that solutions for J{ 2': 3 may be sensitive to the choice of initial conditions in the case of unbiased patterns. Good approximations are obtained generally for J{ = 2 and for biased patterns in the case of J{ 2': 3, especially when Nishimori's temperature is being used. 1 Introduction Belief networks [1] are diagrammatic representations of joint probability distribu tions over a set of variables.

Classification on Pairwise Proximity Data,"We investigate the problem of learning a classification task on data represented in terms of their pairwise proximities. This representa tion does not refer to an explicit feature representation of the data items and is thus more general than the standard approach of us ing Euclidean feature vectors, from which pairwise proximities can always be calculated. Our first approach is based on a combined linear embedding and classification procedure resulting in an ex tension of the Optimal Hyperplane algorithm to pseudo-Euclidean data. As an alternative we present another approach based on a linear threshold model in the proximity values themselves, which is optimized using Structural Risk Minimization.

Using Analytic QP and Sparseness to Speed,"Training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) requires the solution of a very large quadratic programming (QP) problem. This paper proposes an al gorithm for training SVMs: Sequential Minimal Optimization, or SMO. SMO breaks the large QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems which are analytically solvable. Thus, SMO does not require a numerical QP library. SMO's computation time is dominated by eval uation of the kernel, hence kernel optimizations substantially quicken SMO. For the MNIST database, SMO is 1.7 times as fast as PCG chunk ing; while for the UCI Adult database and linear SVMs, SMO can be 1500 times faster than the PCG chunking algorithm. 1 INTRODUCTION In the last few years, there has been a surge of interest in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [1]. SVMs have empirically been shown to give good generalization performance on a wide variety of problems. However, the use of SVMs is stilI limited to a small group of researchers.

Dynamically Adapting Kernels in Support,"The kernel-parameter is one of the few tunable parameters in Sup port Vector machines, controlling the complexity of the resulting hypothesis. Its choice amounts to model selection and its value is usually found by means of a validation set. We present an algo rithm which can automatically perform model selection with little additional computational cost and with no need of a validation set. In this procedure model selection and learning are not separate, but kernels are dynamically adjusted during the learning process to find the kernel parameter which provides the best possible upper bound on the generalisation error. Theoretical results motivating the approach and experimental results confirming its validity are presented. 1 Introduction Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are learning systems designed to automatically trade-off accuracy and complexity by minimizing an upper bound on the general isation error provided by VC theory.

"Temporally Asymmetric Hebbian Learning,","Recent experimental data indicate that the strengthening or weakening of synaptic connections between neurons depends on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. A Hebbian synaptic modification rule based on these data leads to a stable state in which the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to a neuron are balanced, producing an irregular pattern of firing. It has been proposed that neurons in vivo operate in such a mode. 1 Introduction Hebbian modification of network interconnections plays a central role in the study of learn ing in neural networks (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986; Hertz et al., 1991). Most work on Hebbian learning involves network models in which the activities of the individual units are represented by continuous variables. A Hebbian learning rule, in this context, is spec ified by describing how network weights change as a function of the activities of the units that transmit and receive signals across a given network connection.

On the optimality of incremental neural network,"We study the approximation of functions by two-layer feedforward neu ral networks, focusing on incremental algorithms which greedily add units, estimating single unit parameters at each stage. As opposed to standard algorithms for fixed architectures, the optimization at each stage is performed over a small number of parameters, mitigating many of the difficult numerical problems inherent in high-dimensional non-linear op timization. We establish upper bounds on the error incurred by the al gorithm, when approximating functions from the Sobolev class, thereby extending previous results which only provided rates of convergence for functions in certain convex hulls of functional spaces. By comparing our results to recently derived lower bounds, we show that the greedy algo rithms are nearly optimal. Combined with estimation error results for greedy algorithms, a strong case can be made for this type of approach. 1 Introduction and background A major problem in the application of neural n",Optimization & Theoretical ML,81c8727c62e800be708dbf37c4695dff-Paper.pdf,1998
Learning Mixture Hierarchies,"The hierarchical representation of data has various applications in do mains such as data mining, machine vision, or information retrieval. In this paper we introduce an extension of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that learns mixture hierarchies in a computationally ef ficient manner. Efficiency is achieved by progressing in a bottom-up fashion, i.e. by clustering the mixture components of a given level in the hierarchy to obtain those of the level above. This cl ustering requires onl y knowledge of the mixture parameters, there being no need to resort to intermediate samples. In addition to practical applications, the algorithm allows a new interpretation of EM that makes clear the relationship with non-parametric kernel-based estimation methods, provides explicit con trol over the trade-off between the bias and variance of EM estimates, and offers new insights about the behavior of deterministic annealing methods commonly used with EM to escape local minima of the likeli",Optimization & Theoretical ML,819c9fbfb075d62a16393b9fe4fcbaa5-Paper.pdf,1998

"Coding time-varying signals using sparse,","A common way to represent a time series is to divide it into short duration blocks, each of which is then represented by a set of basis functions. A limitation of this approach, however, is that the tem poral alignment of the basis functions with the underlying structure in the time series is arbitrary. We present an algorithm for encoding a time series that does not require blocking the data. The algorithm finds an efficient representation by inferring the best temporal po sitions for functions in a kernel basis. These can have arbitrary temporal extent and are not constrained to be orthogonal. This allows the model to capture structure in the signal that may occur at arbitrary temporal positions and preserves the relative temporal structure of underlying events. The model is shown to be equivalent to a very sparse and highly over complete basis. Under this model, the mapping from the data to the representation is nonlinear, but can be computed efficiently.

Evidence for a Forward Dynamics Model,"Based on computational principles, the concept of an internal model for adaptive control has been divided into a forward and an inverse model. However, there is as yet little evidence that learning control by the eNS is through adaptation of one or the other. Here we examine two adaptive control architectures, one based only on the inverse model and other based on a combination of forward and inverse models. We then show that for reaching movements of the hand in novel force fields, only the learning of the forward model results in key characteristics of performance that match the kine matics of human subjects. In contrast, the adaptive control system that relies only on the inverse model fails to produce the kinematic patterns observed in the subjects, despite the fact that it is more stable. Our results provide evidence that learning control of novel dynamics is via formation of a forward model. 1 Introduction The concept of an internal model, a system for predicting behavior of a co",Optimization & Theoretical ML,86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf,1998
Restructuring Sparse High Dimensional Data for,"The task in text retrieval is to find the subset of a collection of documents relevant to a user's information request, usually expressed as a set of words. Classically, documents and queries are represented as vectors of word counts. In its simplest form, relevance is defined to be the dot product between a document and a query vector-a measure of the number of common terms. A central difficulty in text retrieval is that the presence or absence of a word is not sufficient to determine relevance to a query. Linear dimensionality reduction has been proposed as a tech nique for extracting underlying structure from the document collection. In some domains (such as vision) dimensionality reduction reduces computational com plexity. In text retrieval it is more often used to improve retrieval performance. We propose an alternative and novel technique that produces sparse represen tations constructed from sets of highly-related words.

Classification in Non-Metric Spaces,"A key question in vision is how to represent our knowledge of previously encountered objects to classify new ones. The answer depends on how we determine the similarity of two objects. Similarity tells us how relevant each previously seen object is in determining the category to which a new object belongs. Here a dichotomy emerges. Complex notions of similar ity appear necessary for cognitive models and applications, while simple notions of similarity form a tractable basis for current computational ap proaches to classification. We explore the nature of this dichotomy and why it calls for new approaches to well-studied problems in learning. We begin this process by demonstrating new computational methods for supervised learning that can handle complex notions of similarity.

When learning temporal models, each of the many inference phases requires a traversal over an entire long data se quence; furthermore, the data structures manipulated are exponentially large, making this process computationally expensive. In [2], we describe an approximate inference algorithm for monitoring stochastic processes, and prove bounds on its approximation error. In this paper, we apply this algorithm as an approximate forward propagation step in an EM algorithm for learning temporal Bayesian networks. We provide a related approxi mation for the backward step, and prove error bounds for the combined algorithm.

A Model for Associative Multiplication,"Despite the fact that mental arithmetic is based on only a few hun dred basic facts and some simple algorithms, humans have a diffi cult time mastering the subject, and even experienced individuals make mistakes. Associative multiplication, the process of doing multiplication by memory without the use of rules or algorithms, is especially problematic. Humans exhibit certain characteristic phenomena in performing associative multiplications, both in the type of error and in the error frequency. We propose a model for the process of associative multiplication, and compare its perfor mance in both these phenomena with data from normal humans and from the model proposed by Anderson et al (1994). 1 INTRODUCTION Associative mUltiplication is defined as multiplication done without recourse to computational algorithms, and as such is mainly concerned with recalling the basic times table.

The new method is based on a framework developed by Kivinen and Warmuth for supervised on-line learning. In contrast to gra dient descent and EM, which estimate the mixture's covariance matrices, the proposed method estimates the inverses of the covariance matrices.

Learning Macro-Actions in Reinforcement,"We present a method for automatically constructing macro-actions from scratch from primitive actions during the reinforcement learning process. The overall idea is to reinforce the tendency to perform action b after action a if such a pattern of actions has been rewarded. We test the method on a bicycle task, the car-on-the-hill task, the race-track task and some grid-world tasks. For the bicycle and race-track tasks the use of macro-actions approximately halves the learning time, while for one of the grid-world tasks the learning time is reduced by a factor of 5. The method did not work for the car-on-the-hill task for reasons we discuss in the conclusion. 1 INTRODUCTION A macro-action is a sequence of actions chosen from the primitive actions of the prob lem.1 Lumping actions together as macros can be of great help for solving large prob lems (Korf, 1985a,b; Gullapalli, 1992) and can sometimes greatly speed up learning (lba, 1989; McGovern, Sutton & Fagg, 1997; McGovern & Sutton, 199",Reinforcement Learning,8f19793b2671094e63a15ab883d50137-Paper.pdf,1998

In particular, we show how an agent can plan with these high-level controllers and then use the results of such planning to find an even better plan, by modifying the existing controllers, with negligible additional cost and no re-planning. In one of our examples, the complexity of the problem is reduced from 24 billion state-action pairs to less than a million state-controller pair",Optimization & Theoretical ML,9597353e41e6957b5e7aa79214fcb256-Paper.pdf,1998
Dynamics of Supervised Learning with,"We study the dynamics of supervised learning in layered neural net works, in the regime where the size p of the training set is proportional to the number N of inputs. Here the local fields are no longer described by Gaussian distributions. We use dynamical replica theory to predict the evolution of macroscopic observables, including the relevant error measures, incorporating the old formalism in the limit piN --t 00. 1 INTRODUCTION Much progress has been made in solving the dynamics of supervised learning in layered neural networks, using the strategy of statistical mechanics: by deriving closed laws for the evolution of suitably chosen macroscopic observables (order parameters) in the limit of an infinite system size [1, 2, 3, 4].

A Polygonal Line Algorithm for Constructing,"Principal curves have been defined as ""self consistent"" smooth curves which pass through the ""middle"" of a d-dimensional probability distri bution or data cloud. Recently, we [1] have offered a new approach by defining principal curves as continuous curves of a given length which minimize the expected squared distance between the curve and points of the space randomly chosen according to a given distribution. The new definition made it possible to carry out a theoretical analysis of learning principal curves from training data. In this paper we propose a practical construction based on the new definition. Simulation results demonstrate that the new algorithm compares favorably with previous methods both in terms of performance and computational complexity. 1 Introduction Hastie [2] and Hastie and Stuetzle [3] (hereafter HS) generalized the self consistency prop erty of principal components and introduced the notion of principal curves.

Neuronal Regulation Implements,"Human and animal studies show that mammalian brain undergoes massive synaptic pruning during childhood, removing about half of the synapses until puberty. We have previously shown that main taining network memory performance while synapses are deleted, requires that synapses are properly modified and pruned, remov ing the weaker synapses. We now show that neuronal regulation, a mechanism recently observed to maintain the average neuronal in put field, results in weight-dependent synaptic modification. Under the correct range of the degradation dimension and synaptic up per bound, neuronal regulation removes the weaker synapses and judiciously modifies the remaining synapses. It implements near optimal synaptic modification, and maintains the memory perfor mance of a network undergoing massive synaptic pruning. Thus, this paper shows that in addition to the known effects of Hebbian changes, neuronal regulation may play an important role in the self-organization of brain networks during ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,98986c005e5def2da341b4e0627d4712-Paper.pdf,1998
Finite-Sample Convergence Rates for,"In this paper, we address two issues of long-standing interest in the re inforcement learning literature. First, what kinds of performance guar antees can be made for Q-learning after only a finite number of actions? Second, what quantitative comparisons can be made between Q-learning and model-based (indirect) approaches, which use experience to estimate next-state distributions for off-line value iteration? We first show that both Q-learning and the indirect approach enjoy rather rapid convergence to the optimal policy as a function of the num ber of state transitions observed. In particular, on the order of only + (Nlog(1/c)/c2)(log(N) loglog(l/c)) transitions are sufficient for both algorithms to come within c of the optimal policy, in an idealized model that assumes the observed transitions are ""well-mixed"" throughout an N-state MDP. Thus, the two approaches have roughly the same sample complexity. Perhaps surprisingly, this sample complexity is far less than what is required for ",Reinforcement Learning,99adff456950dd9629a5260c4de21858-Paper.pdf,1998
Global Optimisation of Neural Network,"We propose a novel strategy for training neural networks using se quential sampling-importance resampling algorithms. This global optimisation strategy allows us to learn the probability distribu tion of the network weights in a sequential framework. It is well suited to applications involving on-line, nonlinear, non-Gaussian or non-stationary signal processing. 1 INTRODUCTION This paper addresses sequential training of neural networks using powerful sampling techniques. Sequential techniques are important in many applications of neural net works involving real-time signal processing, where data arrival is inherently sequen tial. Furthermore, one might wish to adopt a sequential training strategy to deal with non-stationarity in signals, so that information from the recent past is lent more credence than information from the distant past. One way to sequentially estimate neural network models is to use a state space formulation and the extended Kalman filter (Singhal and Wu 1988, de Fr",Optimization & Theoretical ML,9c19a2aa1d84e04b0bd4bc888792bd1e-Paper.pdf,1998
Linear Hinge Loss and Average Margin,"We describe a unifying method for proving relative loss bounds for on line linear threshold classification algorithms, such as the Perceptron and the Winnow algorithms. For classification problems the discrete loss is used, i.e., the total number of prediction mistakes. We introduce a con tinuous loss function, called the ""linear hinge loss"", that can be employed to derive the updates of the algorithms. We first prove bounds w.r.t. the linear hinge loss and then convert them to the discrete loss. We intro duce a notion of ""average margin"" of a set of examples . We show how relative loss bounds based on the linear hinge loss can be converted to relative loss bounds i.t.o. the discrete loss using the average margin. 1 Introduction Consider the classical Perceptron algorithm.

Non-linear PI Control Inspired by,"A non-linear modification to PI control is motivated by a model of a signal transduction pathway active in mammalian blood pres sure regulation. This control algorithm, labeled PII (proportional with intermittent integral), is appropriate for plants requiring ex act set-point matching and disturbance attenuation in the presence of infrequent step changes in load disturbances or set-point. The proportional aspect of the controller is independently designed to be a disturbance attenuator and set-point matching is achieved by intermittently invoking an integral controller. The mechanisms observed in the Angiotensin 11/ AT1 signaling pathway are used to control the switching of the integral control. Improved performance over PI control is shown on a model of cyc1opentenol production. A sign change in plant gain at the desirable operating point causes traditional PI control to result in an unstable system.

Learning Instance-Independent Value Functions,"Reinforcement learning methods can be used to improve the performance of local search algorithms for combinatorial optimization by learning an evaluation function that predicts the outcome of search. The eval uation function is therefore able to guide search to low-cost solutions better than can the original cost function. We describe a reinforcement learning method for enhancing local search that combines aspects of pre vious work by Zhang and Dietterich (1995) and Boyan and Moore (1997, Boyan 1998). In an off-line learning phase, a value function is learned that is useful for guiding search for multiple problem sizes and instances. We illustrate our technique by developing several such functions for the Dial-A-Ride Problem.

Support Vector Machines Applied to Face,Face recognition is a K class problem. where K is the number of known individuals; and support vector machines (SVMs) are a binary classi fication method. By reformulating the face recognition problem and re interpreting the output of the SVM classifier. we developed a SVM -based face recognition algorithm. The face recognition problem is formulated as a problem in difference space. which models dissimilarities between two facial images. In difference space we formulate face recognition as a two class problem. The classes are: dissimilarities between faces of the same person. and dissimilarities between faces of different people. By modifying the interpretation of the decision surface generated by SVM. we generated a similarity metric between faces that is learned from ex amples of differences between faces.

This theory includes in a consistent way the naive mean field approximation, as well as the TAP approach and the linear response the orem in statistical physics, giving clear information-theoretic interpreta tions to them. 1 INTRODUCTION Many problems of neural networks, such as learning and pattern recognition, can be cast into a framework of statistical estimation problem. How difficult it is to solve a particular problem depends on a statistical model one employs in solving the problem. For Boltzmann machines[ 1] for example, it is computationally very hard to evaluate expectations of state variables from the model parameters.

It is shown that standard AR-NNs without shortcut connections are asymptotically stationary. If lin ear shortcut connections are allowed, only the shortcut weights determine whether the overall system is stationary, hence standard conditions for linear AR processes can be used. 1 Introduction In this paper we consider the popular class of nonlinear autoregressive processes driven by additive noise, which are defined by stochastic difference equations of form (1) where ft is an iid. noise process.

A Principle for Unsupervised,"Structure in a visual scene can be described at many levels of granular ity. At a coarse level, the scene is composed of objects; at a finer level, each object is made up of parts, and the parts of subparts. In this work, I propose a simple principle by which such hierarchical structure can be extracted from visual scenes: Regularity in the relations among different parts of an object is weaker than in the internal structure of a part. This principle can be applied recursively to define part-whole relationships among elements in a scene. The principle does not make use of object models, categories, or other sorts of higher-level knowledge; rather, part-whole relationships can be established based on the statistics of a set of sample visual scenes. I illustrate with a model that performs unsu pervised decomposition of simple scenes. The model can account for the results from a human learning experiment on the ontogeny of part whole relationships. 1 INTRODUCTION The structure in a visual",Computer Vision,ab541d874c7bc19ab77642849e02b89f-Paper.pdf,1998

Vertex Identification in High Energy,"In High Energy Physics experiments one has to sort through a high flux of events, at a rate of tens of MHz, and select the few that are of interest.

However, the optical flow can be estimated by the use of regularization methods, in which additional constraints are intro duced in terms of a global energy functional that must be minimized.

"Divisive Normalization, Line Attractor","Gain control by divisive inhibition, a.k.a. divisive normalization, has been proposed to be a general mechanism throughout the vi sual cortex. We explore in this study the statistical properties of this normalization in the presence of noise. Using simulations, we show that divisive normalization is a close approximation to a maximum likelihood estimator, which, in the context of population coding, is the same as an ideal observer. We also demonstrate ana lytically that this is a general property of a large class of nonlinear recurrent networks with line attractors. Our work suggests that divisive normalization plays a critical role in noise filtering, and that every cortical layer may be an ideal observer of the activity in the preceding layer.

This provides a flexible way of dealing with uncertainties in sensor information, and al lows the introduction of prior knowledge into low-level perception mod ules.

Both approaches force the optimization to find 'interesting' objects, given the sensor and object characteristics. A higher level classifier was used to interpret the results provided by the model, and to reject spurious solutions. 1 Introduction This paper concerns an application of the Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) probabilistic model (Titterington et aI., 1985) for a robot docking application.

A Phase Space Approach to Minimax,"There has been much recent work on measuring image statistics and on learning probability distributions on images. We observe that the mapping from images to statistics is many-to-one and show it can be quantified by a phase space factor. This phase space approach throws light on the Minimax Entropy technique for learning Gibbs distributions on images with potentials derived from image statistics and elucidates the ambiguities that are inherent to determining the potentials. In addition, it shows that if the phase factor can be approximated by an analytic distribution then this approximation yields a swift ""Minutemax"" algorithm that vastly reduces the computation time for Minimax entropy learning. An illustration of this concept, using a Gaussian to approximate the phase factor, gives a good approximation to the results of Zhu and Mumford (1997) in just seconds of CPU time.

This definition suggests that to fmd texture we look for outliers to the local statistics, and label as texture the regions with no outliers. We present a method, based upon this idea, for labeling points in natural scenes as belonging to texture regions, while simultaneously allowing us to label low level, bottom-up cues for visual attention. This method is based upon recent psychophysics results on processing of texture and popout. 1 WHAT IS TEXTURE, AND WHY DO WE WANT TO FIND IT?

Making Templates Rotationally Invariant:,"This paper describes a simple and efficient method to make template-based object classification invariant to in-plane rotations. The task is divided into two parts: orientation discrimination and classification. The key idea is to perform the orientation discrimination before the classification. This can be accom plished by hypothesizing, in turn, that the input image belongs to each class of interest. The image can then be rotated to maximize its similarity to the train ing images in each class (these contain the prototype object in an upright orien tation). This process yields a set of images, at least one of which will have the object in an upright position. The resulting images can then be classified by models which have been trained with only upright examples.

It was shown to be equivalent to Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), in the sense that both procedures produce the same estimate.

Bayesian modeling of human concept learning,"I consider the problem of learning concepts from small numbers of pos itive examples, a feat which humans perform routinely but which com puters are rarely capable of. Bridging machine learning and cognitive science perspectives, I present both theoretical analysis and an empirical study with human subjects for the simple task oflearning concepts corre sponding to axis-aligned rectangles in a multidimensional feature space. Existing learning models, when applied to this task, cannot explain how subjects generalize from only a few examples of the concept. I propose a principled Bayesian model based on the assumption that the examples are a random sample from the concept to be learned. The model gives precise fits to human behavior on this simple task and provides qualitati ve insights into more complex, realistic cases of concept learning. 1 Introduction The ability to learn concepts from examples is one of the core capacities of human cognition.

The Role of Lateral Cortical Competition,"Lateral competition within a layer of neurons sharpens and localizes the response to an input stimulus. Here, we investigate a model for the ac tivity dependent development of ocular dominance maps which allows to vary the degree of lateral competition. For weak competition, it re sembles a correlation-based learning model and for strong competition, it becomes a self-organizing map. Thus, in the regime of weak compe tition the receptive fields are shaped by the second order statistics of the input patterns, whereas in the regime of strong competition, the higher moments and ""features"" of the individual patterns become important. When correlated localized stimuli from two eyes drive the cortical de velopment we find (i) that a topographic map and binocular, localized receptive fields emerge when the degree of competition exceeds a critical value and (ii) that receptive fields exhibit eye dominance beyond a sec ond critical value. For anti-correlated activity between the eyes, the sec o",Optimization & Theoretical ML,c559da2ba967eb820766939a658022c8-Paper.pdf,1998
Maximum Conditional Likelihood via,"We present the CEM (Conditional Expectation Maximi::ation) al gorithm as an extension of the EM (Expectation M aximi::ation) algorithm to conditional density estimation under missing data. A bounding and maximization process is given to specifically optimize conditional likelihood instead of the usual joint likelihood. We ap ply the method to conditioned mixture models and use bounding techniques to derive the model's update rules. Monotonic conver gence, computational efficiency and regression results superior to EM are demonstrated. 1 Introduction Conditional densities have played an important role in statistics and their merits over joint density models have been debated. Advantages in feature selection, ro bustness and limited resource allocation have been studied. Ultimately, tasks such as regression and classification reduce to the evaluation of a conditional density.

Source Separation as a,"This paper reveals a previously ignored connection between two important fields: regularization and independent component anal ysis (ICA). We show that at least one representative of a broad class of algorithms (regularizers that reduce network complexity) extracts independent features as a by-product. This algorithm is Flat Minimum Search (FMS), a recent general method for finding low-complexity networks with high generalization capability. FMS works by minimizing both training error and required weight pre cision. According to our theoretical analysis the hidden layer of an FMS-trained autoassociator attempts at coding each input by a sparse code with as few simple features as possible. In experi ments the method extracts optimal codes for difficult versions of the ""noisy bars"" benchmark problem by separating the underlying sources, whereas ICA and PCA fail. Real world images are coded with fewer bits per pixel than by ICA or PCA. 1 INTRODUCTION In the field of unsupervised learning ",Computer Vision,d1dc3a8270a6f9394f88847d7f0050cf-Paper.pdf,1998

Unsupervised Classification with,"We present an unsupervised classification algorithm based on an ICA mixture model. The ICA mixture model assumes that the observed data can be categorized into several mutually exclusive data classes in which the components in each class are generated by a linear mixture of independent sources. The algorithm finds the independent sources, the mixing matrix for each class and also computes the class membership probability for each data point. This approach extends the Gaussian mixture model so that the classes can have non-Gaussian structure. We demonstrate that this method can learn efficient codes to represent images of natural scenes and text. The learned classes of basis functions yield a better approximation of the underlying distributions of the data, and thus can provide greater coding efficiency. We believe that this method is well suited to modeling structure in high-dimensional data and has many potential applications. 1 Introd uction Recently, Blind Source Separation (BSS) by",NLP,d72fbbccd9fe64c3a14f85d225a046f4-Paper.pdf,1998
Barycentric Interpolators for Continuous,"In order to find the optimal control of continuous state-space and time reinforcement learning (RL) problems, we approximate the value function (VF) with a particular class of functions called the barycentric interpolators. We establish sufficient conditions under which a RL algorithm converges to the optimal VF, even when we use approximate models of the state dynamics and the reinforce ment functions. 1 INTRODUCTION In order to approximate the value function (VF) of a continuous state-space and time reinforcement learning (RL) problem, we define a particular class of functions called the barycentric interpolator, that use some interpolation process based on finite sets of points. This class of functions, including continuous or discontinuous piecewise linear and multi-linear functions, provides us with a general method for designing RL algorithms that converge to the optimal value function.

Learning a Continuous Hidden Variable,"A directed generative model for binary data using a small number of hidden continuous units is investigated. A clipping nonlinear ity distinguishes the model from conventional principal components analysis. The relationships between the correlations of the underly ing continuous Gaussian variables and the binary output variables are utilized to learn the appropriate weights of the network. The advantages of this approach are illustrated on a translationally in variant binary distribution and on handwritten digit images. Introduction Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique for rep resenting data with a large number of variables [1]. It is based upon the assumption that although the data is embedded in a high dimensional vector space, most of the variability in the data is captured by a much lower climensional manifold.

On the other hand, discriminative methods such as support vector machines enable us to construct flexible decision boundaries and often result in classification per formance superior to that of the model based approaches. An ideal classifier should combine these two complementary approaches. In this paper, we develop a natural way of achieving this combina tion by deriving kernel functions for use in discriminative methods such as support vector machines from generative probability mod els. We provide a theoretical justification for this combination as well as demonstrate a substantial improvement in the classification performance in the context of D~A and protein sequence analysis. 1 Introduction Speech, vision, text and biosequence data can be difficult to deal with in the context of simple statistical classification problem",NLP,db1915052d15f7815c8b88e879465a1e-Paper.pdf,1998
Perceiving without Learning: from Spirals to,"As a benchmark task, the spiral problem is well known in neural net works. Unlike previous work that emphasizes learning, we approach the problem from a generic perspective that does not involve learning. We point out that the spiral problem is intrinsically connected to the in side/outside problem. A generic solution to both problems is proposed based on oscillatory correlation using a time delay network. Our simu lation results are qualitatively consistent with human performance, and we interpret human limitations in terms of synchrony and time delays, both biologically plausible. As a special case, our network without time delays can always distinguish these figures regardless of shape, position, size, and orientation. 1 INTRODUCTION The spiral problem refers to distinguishing between a connected single spiral and discon nected double spirals, as illustrated in Fig. 1.

Blind Separation of Filtered Sources,"In this paper we present a novel approach to multichannel blind separation/generalized deconvolution, assuming that both mixing and demixing models are described by stable linear state-space sys tems. We decompose the blind separation problem into two pro cess: separation and state estimation. Based on the minimization of Kullback-Leibler Divergence, we develop a novel learning algo rithm to train the matrices in the output equation. To estimate the state of the demixing model, we introduce a new concept, called hidden innovation, to numerically implement the Kalman filter. Computer simulations are given to show the validity and high ef fectiveness of the state-space approach. 1 Introd uction The field of blind separation and deconvolution has grown dramatically during re cent years due to its similarity to the separation feature in human brain, as well as its rapidly growing applications in various fields, such as telecommunication systems, image enhancement and biomedical signal proc",Optimization & Theoretical ML,dfa92d8f817e5b08fcaafb50d03763cf-Paper.pdf,1998
Recurrent Cortical Amplification Produces,"Cortical amplification has been proposed as a mechanism for enhancing the selectivity of neurons in the primary visual cortex. Less appreciated is the fact that the same form of amplification can also be used to de-tune or broaden selectivity. Using a network model with recurrent cortical circuitry, we propose that the spatial phase invariance of complex cell responses arises through recurrent amplification of feedforward input. Neurons in the network respond like simple cells at low gain and com plex ceUs at high gain. Similar recurrent mechanisms may playa role in generating invariant representations of feedforward input elsewhere in the visual processing pathway. 1 INTRODUCTION Synaptic input to neurons in the primary visual cortex is primarily recurrent, arising from other cortical cells.

Viewing Classifier Systems,"Classifier systems are now viewed disappointing because of their prob lems such as the rule strength vs rule set performance problem and the credit assignment problem. In order to solve the problems, we have de veloped a hybrid classifier system: GLS (Generalization Learning Sys tem). In designing GLS, we view CSs as model free learning in POMDPs and take a hybrid approach to finding the best generalization, given the total number of rules. GLS uses the policy improvement procedure by Jaakkola et al. for an locally optimal stochastic policy when a set of rule conditions is given. GLS uses GA to search for the best set of rule conditions. 1 INTRODUCTION Classifier systems (CSs) (Holland 1986) have been among the most used in reinforcement learning. Some of the advantages of CSs are (1) they have a built-in feature (the use of don't care symbols ""#"") for input generalization, and (2) the complexity of pOlicies can be controlled by restricting the number of rules.

Reinforcement Learning based on,"In this article, we propose a new reinforcement learning (RL) method based on an actor-critic architecture. The actor and the critic are approximated by Normalized Gaussian Networks (NGnet), which are networks of local linear regression units. The NGnet is trained by the on-line EM algorithm proposed in our pre vious paper. We apply our RL method to the task of swinging-up and stabilizing a single pendulum and the task of balancing a dou ble pendulum near the upright position. The experimental results show that our RL method can be applied to optimal control prob lems having continuous state/action spaces and that the method achieves good control with a small number of trial-and-errors. 1 INTRODUCTION Reinforcement learning (RL) methods (Barto et al., 1990) have been successfully applied to various Markov decision problems having finite state/action spaces, such as the backgammon game (Tesauro, 1992) and a complex task in a dynamic envi ronment (Lin, 1992).

Learning multi-class dynamics,"Standard techniques (eg. Yule-Walker) are available for learning Auto-Regressive process models of simple, directly observable, dy namical processes. When sensor noise means that dynamics are observed only approximately, learning can still been achieved via Expectation-Maximisation (EM) together with Kalman Filtering. However, this does not handle more complex dynamics, involving multiple classes of motion. For that problem, we show here how EM can be combined with the CONDENSATION algorithm, which is based on propagation of random sample-sets. Experiments have been performed with visually observed juggling, and plausible dy namical models are found to emerge from the learning process. 1 Introduction The paper presents a probabilistic framework for estimation (perception) and classi fication of complex time-varying signals, represented as temporal streams of states.

Markov processes on curves for,"We investigate a probabilistic framework for automatic speech recognition based on the intrinsic geometric properties of curves. In particular, we analyze the setting in which two variables-one continuous (~), one discrete (s )-evolve jointly in time. We sup pose that the vector ~ traces out a smooth multidimensional curve and that the variable s evolves stochastically as a function of the arc length traversed along this curve. Since arc length does not depend on the rate at which a curve is traversed, this gives rise to a family of Markov processes whose predictions, Pr[sl~]' are invariant to nonlinear warpings of time. We describe the use of such models, known as Markov processes on curves (MPCs), for automatic speech recognition, where ~ are acoustic feature trajec tories and s are phonetic transcriptions. On two tasks-recognizing New Jersey town names and connected alpha-digits- we find that MPCs yield lower word error rates than comparably trained hidden Markov models. 1 Introduct",Computer Vision,ebd6d2f5d60ff9afaeda1a81fc53e2d0-Paper.pdf,1998

Utilizing Time: Asynchronous Binding,"Historically, connectionist systems have not excelled at represent ing and manipulating complex structures. How can a system com posed of simple neuron-like computing elements encode complex relations? Recently, researchers have begun to appreciate that rep resentations can extend in both time and space. Many researchers have proposed that the synchronous firing of units can encode com plex representations. I identify the limitations of this approach and present an asynchronous model of binding that effectively rep resents complex structures. The asynchronous model extends the synchronous approach. I argue that our cognitive architecture uti lizes a similar mechanism. 1 Introduction Simple connectionist models can fall prey to the ""binding problem"".

The effect of eligibility traces on finding optimal memoryless,"Agents acting in the real world are confronted with the problem of making good decisions with limited knowledge of the environment. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) model decision problems in which an agent tries to maximize its reward in the face of limited sensor feedback. Recent work has shown empirically that a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm called Sarsa(A) can efficiently find optimal memoryless policies, which map current observations to actions, for POMDP problems (Loch and Singh 1998). The Sarsa(A) algorithm uses a form of short-term memory called an eligibility trace, which distributes temporally delayed rewards to observation-action pairs which lead up to the reward. This paper explores the effect of eligibility traces on the ability of the Sarsa(A) algorithm to find optimal memoryless policies. A variant of Sarsa(A) called k-step truncated Sarsa(A) is applied to four test problems taken from the recent work of Littman, Littman, Cassandra and Kae",Reinforcement Learning,f3173935ed8ac4bf073c1bcd63171f8a-Paper.pdf,1998

A VI model of pop out and asymmetry â¢,"Visual search is the task of finding a target in an image against a background of distractors. Unique features of targets enable them to pop out against the background, while targets defined by lacks of features or conjunctions of features are more difficult to spot. It is known that the ease of target detection can change when the roles of figure and ground are switched. The mechanisms underlying the ease of pop out and asymmetry in visual search have been elusive. This paper shows that a model of segmentation in VI based on intracortical interactions can explain many of the qualitative aspects of visual search. 1 Introduction Visual search is closely related to visual segmentation, and therefore can be used to diagnose the mechanisms of visual segmentation. For instance, a red dot can pop out against a background of green distractor dots instantaneously, suggesting that only pre-attentive mechanisms are necessary (Treisman et aI, 1990).

Regular and Irregular Gallager-type,"The performance of regular and irregular Gallager-type error correcting code is investigated via methods of statistical physics. The transmitted codeword comprises products of the original mes sage bits selected by two randomly-constructed sparse matrices; the number of non-zero row/column elements in these matrices constitutes a family of codes. We show that Shannon's channel capacity may be saturated in equilibrium for many of the regular codes while slightly lower performance is obtained for others which may be of higher practical relevance. Decoding aspects are con sidered by employing the TAP approach which is identical to the commonly used belief-propagation-based decoding.

U nmixing Hyperspectral Data,"In hyperspectral imagery one pixel typically consists of a mixture of the reflectance spectra of several materials, where the mixture coefficients correspond to the abundances of the constituting ma terials. We assume linear combinations of reflectance spectra with some additive normal sensor noise and derive a probabilistic MAP framework for analyzing hyperspectral data. As the material re flectance characteristics are not know a priori, we face the problem of unsupervised linear unmixing. The incorporation of different prior information (e.g. positivity and normalization of the abun dances) naturally leads to a family of interesting algorithms, for example in the noise-free case yielding an algorithm that can be understood as constrained independent component analysis (ICA). Simulations underline the usefulness of our theory. 1 Introduction Current hyperspectral remote sensing technology can form images of ground surface reflectance at a few hundred wavelengths simultaneously, with w",Computer Vision,0efbe98067c6c73dba1250d2beaa81f9-Paper.pdf,1999
Correctness of belief propagation in Gaussian,"Local ""belief propagation"" rules of the sort proposed by Pearl [15] are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities in singly connected graphical models. Recently, a number of researchers have em pirically demonstrated good performance of ""loopy belief propagation"" using these same rules on graphs with loops. Perhaps the most dramatic instance is the near Shannon-limit performance of ""Turbo codes"", whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy belief propagation. Except for the case of graphs with a single loop, there has been little theo retical understanding of the performance of loopy propagation. Here we analyze belief propagation in networks with arbitrary topologies when the nodes in the graph describe jointly Gaussian random variables. We give an analytical formula relating the true posterior probabilities with those calculated using loopy propagation. We give sufficient conditions for convergence and show that when belief propagation converges it gives the c",Optimization & Theoretical ML,10c272d06794d3e5785d5e7c5356e9ff-Paper.pdf,1999
Population Decoding Based on,"We study a population decoding paradigm in which the maximum likeli hood inference is based on an unfaithful decoding model (UMLI). This is usually the case for neural population decoding because the encoding process of the brain is not exactly known, or because a simplified de coding model is preferred for saving computational cost. We consider an unfaithful decoding model which neglects the pair-wise correlation between neuronal activities, and prove that UMLI is asymptotically effi cient when the neuronal correlation is uniform or of limited-range. The performance of UMLI is compared with that of the maximum likelihood inference based on a faithful model and that of the center of mass de coding method. It turns out that UMLI has advantages of decreasing the computational complexity remarkablely and maintaining a high-level decoding accuracy at the same time. The effect of correlation on the decoding accuracy is also discussed. 1 Introduction Population coding is a method to encode a",Computer Vision,11c484ea9305ea4c7bb6b2e6d570d466-Paper.pdf,1999
Broadband Direction-Of-Arrival Estimation,"N wideband sources recorded using N closely spaced receivers can feasibly be separated based only on second order statistics when using a physical model of the mixing process. In this case we show that the parameter estimation problem can be essentially reduced to considering directions of arrival and attenuations of each signal. The paper presents two demixing methods operating in the time and frequency domain and experimentally shows that it is always possible to demix signals arriving at different angles. Moreover, one can use spatial cues to solve the channel selection problem and a post-processing Wiener filter to ameliorate the artifacts caused by demixing. 1 Introduction Blind source separation (BSS) is capable of dramatic results when used to separate mixtures of independent signals. The method relies on simultaneous recordings of signals from two or more input sensors and separates the original sources purely on the basis of statistical independence between them.

Emergence of Topography and Complex,"Independent component analysis of natural images leads to emer gence of simple cell properties, Le. linear filters that resemble wavelets or Gabor functions. In this paper, we extend ICA to explain further properties of VI cells. First, we decompose natural images into independent subspaces instead of scalar components. This model leads to emergence of phase and shift invariant fea tures, similar to those in VI complex cells. Second, we define a topography between the linear components obtained by ICA. The topographic distance between two components is defined by their higher-order correlations, so that two components are close to each other in the topography if they are strongly dependent on each other. This leads to simultaneous emergence of both topography and invariances similar to complex cell properties. 1 Introduction A fundamental approach in signal processing is to design a statistical generative model of the observed signals.

Reinforcement Learning Using Approximate,"The problem of developing good policies for partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs) remains one of the most challenging ar eas of research in stochastic planning. One line of research in this area involves the use of reinforcement learning with belief states, probabil ity distributions over the underlying model states. This is a promis ing method for small problems, but its application is limited by the in tractability of computing or representing a full belief state for large prob lems. Recent work shows that, in many settings, we can maintain an approximate belief state, which is fairly close to the true belief state. In particular, great success has been shown with approximate belief states that marginalize out correlations between state variables. In this paper, we investigate two methods of full belief state reinforcement learning and one novel method for reinforcement learning using factored approximate belief states. We compare the performance of these algorithms ",Reinforcement Learning,158fc2ddd52ec2cf54d3c161f2dd6517-Paper.pdf,1999
Building Predictive Models from Fractal,"We propose a novel approach for building finite memory predictive mod els similar in spirit to variable memory length Markov models (VLMMs). The models are constructed by first transforming the n-block structure of the training sequence into a spatial structure of points in a unit hypercube, such that the longer is the common suffix shared by any two n-blocks, the closer lie their point representations. Such a transformation embodies a Markov assumption - n-blocks with long common suffixes are likely to produce similar continuations. Finding a set of prediction contexts is formulated as a resource allocation problem solved by vector quantizing the spatial n-block representation. We compare our model with both the classical and variable memory length Markov models on three data sets with different memory and stochastic components. Our models have a superior performance, yet, their construction is fully automatic, which is shown to be problematic in the case of VLMMs. 1 Introduction Stat",Optimization & Theoretical ML,17ed8abedc255908be746d245e50263a-Paper.pdf,1999
Neural Computation with Winner-Take-All as,"Everybody ""knows"" that neural networks need more than a single layer of nonlinear units to compute interesting functions. We show that this is false if one employs winner-take-all as nonlinear unit: â¢ Any boolean function can be computed by a single k-winner-take all unit applied to weighted sums of the input variables. â¢ Any continuous function can be approximated arbitrarily well by a single soft winner-take-all unit applied to weighted sums of the input variables. â¢ Only positive weights are needed in these (linear) weighted sums. This may be of interest from the point of view of neurophysiology, since only 15% of the synapses in the cortex are inhibitory.

Support Vector Method for Multivariate,"A new method for multivariate density estimation is developed based on the Support Vector Method (SVM) solution of inverse ill-posed problems. The solution has the form of a mixture of den sities. This method with Gaussian kernels compared favorably to both Parzen's method and the Gaussian Mixture Model method. For synthetic data we achieve more accurate estimates for densities of 2, 6, 12, and 40 dimensions. 1 Introduction The problem of multivariate density estimation is important for many applications, in particular, for speech recognition [1] [7]. When the unknown density belongs to a parametric set satisfying certain conditions one can estimate it using the maximum likelihood (ML) method. Often these conditions are too restrictive. Therefore, non-parametric methods were proposed. The most popular of these, Parzen's method [5], uses the following estimate given data Xl, ... , Xl: (1) J = where K'Yl(t - Xi) is a smooth function such that K'Yl(t - xi)dt 1.

Leveraged Vector Machines,"We describe an iterative algorithm for building vector machines used in classification tasks. The algorithm builds on ideas from support vector machines, boosting, and generalized additive models. The algorithm can be used with various continuously differential functions that bound the discrete (0-1) classification loss and is very simple to implement. We test the proposed algorithm with two different loss functions on synthetic and natural data. We also describe a norm-penalized version of the algorithm for the exponential loss function used in AdaBoost. The performance of the algorithm on natural data is comparable to support vector machines while typically its running time is shorter than of SVM. 1 Introduction Support vector machines (SVM) [1, 13] and boosting [10, 3, 4, 11] are highly popular and effective methods for constructing linear classifiers.

The parameters are learned on-line, and approx imations are used to perform inference and to compute the optimal value function. The relative effects of inference and value function approxi mations on the quality of the final policy are investigated, by learning to solve a moderately difficult driving task. The two value function approx imations, linear and quadratic, were found to perform similarly, but the quadratic model was more sensitive to initialization. Both performed be low the level of human performance on the task. The dynamic Bayesian network performed comparably to a model using a localist hidden state representation, while requiring exponentially fewer parameters. 1 Introduction Reinforcement learning (RL) addresses the problem of learning to act",Reinforcement Learning,231141b34c82aa95e48810a9d1b33a79-Paper.pdf,1999
Variational Inference for Bayesian,"We present an algorithm that infers the model structure of a mix ture of factor analysers using an efficient and deterministic varia tional approximation to full Bayesian integration over model pa rameters. This procedure can automatically determine the opti mal number of components and the local dimensionality of each component (Le. the number of factors in each factor analyser). Alternatively it can be used to infer posterior distributions over number of components and dimensionalities. Since all parameters are integrated out the method is not prone to overfitting. Using a stochastic procedure for adding components it is possible to per form the variational optimisation incrementally and to avoid local maxima. Results show that the method works very well in practice and correctly infers the number and dimensionality of nontrivial synthetic examples.

We describe a way to add transformation invari ance to a generative density model by approximating the nonlinear transformation manifold by a discrete set of transformations. An EM algorithm for the original model can be extended to the new model by computing expectations over the set of transformations. We show how to add a discrete transformation variable to Gaussian mixture modeling, factor analysis and mixtures of factor analysis.

Channel Noise in Excitable Neuronal,"Stochastic fluctuations of voltage-gated ion channels generate current and voltage noise in neuronal membranes. This noise may be a criti cal determinant of the efficacy of information processing within neural systems. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we carry out a systematic in vestigation of the relationship between channel kinetics and the result ing membrane voltage noise using a stochastic Markov version of the Mainen-Sejnowski model of dendritic excitability in cortical neurons. Our simulations show that kinetic parameters which lead to an increase in membrane excitability (increasing channel densities, decreasing tem perature) also lead to an increase in the magnitude of the sub-threshold voltage noise. Noise also increases as the membrane is depolarized from rest towards threshold. This suggests that channel fluctuations may in terfere with a neuron's ability to function as an integrator of its synaptic inputs and may limit the reliability and precision of neural information pro",Optimization & Theoretical ML,2612aa892d962d6f8056b195ca6e550d-Paper.pdf,1999
Efficient Approaches to Gaussian Process,"We present three simple approximations for the calculation of the posterior mean in Gaussian Process classification.

This agrees with the anatomical data from retinal and cerebellar neurons whose morphol ogy and connectivity are known.

v-Arc: Ensemble Learning,"AdaBoost and other ensemble methods have successfully been ap plied to a number of classification tasks, seemingly defying prob lems of overfitting. AdaBoost performs gradient descent in an error function with respect to the margin, asymptotically concentrating on the patterns which are hardest to learn. For very noisy prob lems, however, this can be disadvantageous. Indeed, theoretical analysis has shown that the margin distribution, as opposed to just the minimal margin, plays a crucial role in understanding this phe nomenon. Loosely speaking, some outliers should be tolerated if this has the benefit of substantially increasing the margin on the remaining points.

Monte Carlo POMDPs,"We present a Monte Carlo algorithm for learning to act in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with real-valued state and action spaces. Our approach uses importance sampling for representing beliefs, and Monte Carlo approximation for belief propagation. A reinforcement learning algorithm, value iteration, is employed to learn value functions over belief states. Finally, a sample based version of nearest neighbor is used to generalize across states. Initial empirical results suggest that our approach works well in practical applications. 1 Introduction POMDPs address the problem of acting optimally in partially observable dynamic environ ment [6]. In POMDPs, a learner interacts with a stochastic environment whose state is only partially observable.

The model qualitatively reproduces many of the experimental data on these types of tasks and provides a framework for the understanding of the experimental observations in the context of the attractor neural network scenario. 1 Introduction Working memory is usually defined as the capability to actively hold information in mem ory for short periods of time. In primates, visual working memory is usually studied in experiments in which, after the presentation of a given visual stimulus, the monkey has to withhold its response during a certain delay period in which no specific visual stimulus is shown.

According to this law choice probability ratios factorize into components independently con trolled by stimulus and context. It has been argued that this pat tern of results is incompatible with feedback models of perception. In this paper we examine this claim using neural network models defined via stochastic differential equations. We show that the law is related to a condition named channel separability and has little to do with the existence of feedback connections. In essence, chan nels are separable if they converge into the response units without direct lateral connections to other channels and if their sensors are not directly contaminated by external inputs to the other chan nels.

Hierarchical Image Probability (HIP) Models,"We formulate a model for probability distributions on image spaces. We show that any distribution of images can be factored exactly into condi tional distributions of feature vectors at one resolution (pyramid level) conditioned on the image information at lower resolutions. We would like to factor this over positions in the pyramid levels to make it tractable, but such factoring may miss long-range dependencies. To fix this, we in troduce hidden class labels at each pixel in the pyramid. The result is a hierarchical mixture of conditional probabilities, similar to a hidden Markov model on a tree. The model parameters can be found with max imum likelihood estimation using the EM algorithm.

Distributed Synchrony of Spiking Neurons,"We investigate the behavior of a Hebbian cell assembly of spiking neurons formed via a temporal synaptic learning curve. This learn ing function is based on recent experimental findings. It includes potentiation for short time delays between pre- and post-synaptic neuronal spiking, and depression for spiking events occuring in the reverse order. The coupling between the dynamics of the synaptic learning and of the neuronal activation leads to interesting results. We find that the cell assembly can fire asynchronously, but may also function in complete synchrony, or in distributed synchrony. The latter implies spontaneous division of the Hebbian cell assem bly into groups of cells that fire in a cyclic manner. We invetigate the behavior of distributed synchrony both by simulations and by analytic calculations of the resulting synaptic distributions. 1 Introduction The Hebbian paradigm that serves as the basis for models of associative memory is often conceived as the statement that a gr",Optimization & Theoretical ML,375c71349b295fbe2dcdca9206f20a06-Paper.pdf,1999

The algorithms can also be explained by their generic behavior near a singular point where the size of the opti mal generative bases vanishes. An expansion of the likelihood about this singular point indicates the role of higher order correlations in determin ing the features discovered by ICA.

Can VI mechanisms account for,"When a visual image consists of a figure against a background, V1 cells are physiologically observed to give higher responses to image regions corresponding to the figure relative to their responses to the background. The medial axis of the figure also induces rela tively higher responses compared to responses to other locations in the figure (except for the boundary between the figure and the background). Since the receptive fields of V1 cells are very smal l compared with the global scale of the figure-ground and medial axis effects, it has been suggested that these effects may be caused by feedback from higher visual areas. I show how these effects can be accounted for by V1 mechanisms when the size of the figure is small or is of a certain scale.

Lower Bounds on the Complexity of,"We calculate lower bounds on the size of sigmoidal neural networks that approximate continuous functions.

Large Margin DAGs for,"We present a new learning architecture: the Decision Directed Acyclic Graph (DDAG), which is used to combine many two-class classifiers into a multiclass classifier. For an N -class problem, the DDAG con tains N(N - 1)/2 classifiers, one for each pair of classes. We present a VC analysis of the case when the node classifiers are hyperplanes; the re sulting bound on the test error depends on N and on the margin achieved at the nodes, but not on the dimension of the space. This motivates an algorithm, DAGSVM, which operates in a kernel-induced feature space and uses two-class maximal margin hyperplanes at each decision-node of the DDAG. The DAGSVM is substantially faster to train and evalu ate than either the standard algorithm or Max Wins, while maintaining comparable accuracy to both of these algorithms. 1 Introduction The problem of multiclass classificatIon, especially for systems like SVMs, doesn't present an easy solution. It is generally simpler to construct classifier theory and ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,4abe17a1c80cbdd2aa241b70840879de-Paper.pdf,1999
Approximate Planning in Large POMDPs,"We consider the problem of reliably choosing a near-best strategy from a restricted class of strategies TI in a partially observable Markov deci sion process (POMDP). We assume we are given the ability to simulate the POMDP, and study what might be called the sample complexity - that is, the amount of data one must generate in the POMDP in order to choose a good strategy. We prove upper bounds on the sample com plexity showing that, even for infinitely large and arbitrarily complex POMDPs, the amount of data needed can be finite, and depends only linearly on the complexity of the restricted strategy class TI, and expo nentially on the horizon time. This latter dependence can be eased in a variety of ways, including the application of gradient and local search algorithms. Our measure of complexity generalizes the classical super vised learning notion of VC dimension to the settings of reinforcement learning and planning. 1 Introduction Much recent attention has been focused on partially",Reinforcement Learning,4f398cb9d6bc79ae567298335b51ba8a-Paper.pdf,1999
The Relaxed Online,"We describe a new incremental algorithm for training linear thresh old functions: the Relaxed Online Maximum Margin Algorithm, or ROMMA. ROMMA can be viewed as an approximation to the algorithm that repeatedly chooses the hyperplane that classifies previously seen ex amples correctly with the maximum margin. It is known that such a maximum-margin hypothesis can be computed by minimizing the length of the weight vector subject to a number of linear constraints. ROMMA works by maintaining a relatively simple relaxation of these constraints that can be efficiently updated. We prove a mistake bound for ROMMA that is the same as that proved for the perceptron algorithm. Our analysis implies that the more computationally intensive maximum-margin algo rithm also satisfies this mistake bound; this is the first worst-case perfor mance guarantee for this algorithm. We describe some experiments us ing ROMMA and a variant that updates its hypothesis more aggressively as batch algorithms to recogni",Optimization & Theoretical ML,515ab26c135e92ed8bf3a594d67e4ade-Paper.pdf,1999
Maximum entropy discrimination,"We present a general framework for discriminative estimation based on the maximum entropy principle and its extensions. All calcula tions involve distributions over structures and/or parameters rather than specific settings and reduce to relative entropy projections. This holds even when the data is not separable within the chosen parametric class, in the context of anomaly detection rather than classification, or when the labels in the training set are uncertain or incomplete. Support vector machines are naturally subsumed un der this class and we provide several extensions. We are also able to estimate exactly and efficiently discriminative distributions over tree structures of class-conditional models within this framework. Preliminary experimental results are indicative of the potential in these techniques. 1 Introduction Effective discrimination is essential in many application areas.

Bayesian modelling of tMRI time series,"We present a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for inferring the hidden psychological state (or neural activity) during single trial tMRI activa tion experiments with blocked task paradigms. Inference is based on Bayesian methodology, using a combination of analytical and a variety of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques. The ad vantage of this method is that detection of short time learning effects be tween repeated trials is possible since inference is based only on single trial experiments. 1 Introduction Functional magnetic resonance imaging (tMRI) is a non-invasive technique that enables indirect measures of neuronal activity in the working human brain. The most common tMRI technique is based on an image contrast induced by temporal shifts in the relative concentration of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin (BOLD contrast). Since neuronal activation leads to an increased blood flow, the so-called hemodynamic response, the mea sured tMRI signal reflects neuronal activity.

Bayesian averaging is well-temperated,"Bayesian predictions are stochastic just like predictions of any other inference scheme that generalize from a finite sample. While a sim ple variational argument shows that Bayes averaging is generaliza tion optimal given that the prior matches the teacher parameter distribution the situation is less clear if the teacher distribution is unknown. I define a class of averaging procedures, the temperated likelihoods, including both Bayes averaging with a uniform prior and maximum likelihood estimation as special cases. I show that Bayes is generalization optimal in this family for any teacher dis tribution for two learning problems that are analytically tractable: learning the mean of a Gaussian and asymptotics of smooth learn ers. 1 Introduction Learning is the stochastic process of generalizing from a random finite sample of data.

Policy Search via Density Estimation,"We propose a new approach to the problem of searching a space of stochastic controllers for a Markov decision process (MDP) or a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Following several other authors, our approach is based on searching in parameterized families of policies (for example, via gradient descent) to optimize solution qual ity. However, rather than trying to estimate the values and derivatives of a policy directly, we do so indirectly using estimates for the proba bility densities that the policy induces on states at the different points in time. This enables our algorithms to exploit the many techniques for efficient and robust approximate density propagation in stochastic sys tems. We show how our techniques can be applied both to deterministic propagation schemes (where the MDP's dynamics are given explicitly in compact form,) and to stochastic propagation schemes (where we have access only to a generative model, or simulator, of the MDP).

Low Power Wireless Communication via,"This paper examines the application of reinforcement learning to a wire less communication problem. The problem requires that channel util ity be maximized while simultaneously minimizing battery usage. We present a solution to this multi-criteria problem that is able to signifi cantly reduce power consumption. The solution uses a variable discount factor to capture the effects of battery usage. 1 Introduction Reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to resource allocation problems in telecom munications, e.g., channel allocation in wireless systems, network routing, and admission control in telecommunication networks [1,2, 8, 10]. These have demonstrated reinforce ment learning can find good policies that significantly increase the application reward within the dynamics of the telecommunication problems.

Learning to Parse Images,"We describe a class of probabilistic models that we call credibility networks. Using parse trees as internal representations of images, credibility networks are able to perform segmentation and recog nition simultaneously, removing the need for ad hoc segmentation heuristics. Promising results in the problem of segmenting hand written digits were obtained. 1 Introd uction The task of recognition has been the main focus of attention of statistical pattern recognition for the past 40 years. The paradigm problem is to classify an object from a vector of features extracted from the image. With the advent of backpropagation [1], the choice of features and the choice of weights to put on these features became part of a single, overall optimization and impressive performance was obtained for restricted but important tasks such as handwritten character identification [2]. A significant weakness of many current recognition systems is their reliance on a separate preprocessing stage that segment",Computer Vision,5a142a55461d5fef016acfb927fee0bd-Paper.pdf,1999
Robust Recognition of Noisy and Superimposed,"In many classification tasks, recognition accuracy is low because input patterns are corrupted by noise or are spatially or temporally overlapping. We propose an approach to overcoming these limitations based on a model of human selective attention. The model, an early selection filter guided by top-down attentional control, entertains each candidate output class in sequence and adjusts attentional gain coefficients in order to produce a strong response for that class. The chosen class is then the one that obtains the strongest response with the least modulation of attention. We present simulation results on classification of corrupted and superimposed handwritten digit patterns, showing a significant improvement in recognition rates. The algorithm has also been applied in the domain of speech recognition, with comparable results. 1 Introduction In many classification tasks, recognition accuracy is low because input patterns are corrupted by noise or are spatially or temporally overlap",Computer Vision,5cf21ce30208cfffaa832c6e44bb567d-Paper.pdf,1999
Bayesian Network Induction via Local,"In recent years, Bayesian networks have become highly successful tool for di agnosis, analysis, and decision making in real-world domains. We present an efficient algorithm for learning Bayes networks from data. Our approach con structs Bayesian networks by first identifying each node's Markov blankets, then connecting nodes in a maximally consistent way. In contrast to the majority of work, which typically uses hill-climbing approaches that may produce dense and causally incorrect nets, our approach yields much more compact causal networks by heeding independencies in the data. Compact causal networks facilitate fast in ference and are also easier to understand. We prove that under mild assumptions, our approach requires time polynomial in the size of the data and the number of nodes. A randomized variant, also presented here, yields comparable results at much higher speeds. 1 Introduction A great number of scientific fields today benefit from being able to automatically estimate the ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,5d79099fcdf499f12b79770834c0164a-Paper.pdf,1999

Then we show how the precise times of spikes can be used to con vey the real-valued coefficients on the basis functions quickly and accurately. Finally we describe a simple simulation in which spik ing neurons learn to model an image sequence by fitting a dynamic generative model. 1 Population codes and energy landscapes A perceived object is represented in the brain by the activities of many neurons, but there is no general consensus on how the activities of individual neurons combine to represent the multiple properties of an object. We start by focussing on the case of a single object that has multiple instantiation parameters such as position, velocity, size and orientation. We assume that each neuron has an ideal stimulus in the space of instantiation parameters and that its activation rate or probability of activation falls off monotonically i",Computer Vision,62889e73828c756c961c5a6d6c01a463-Paper.pdf,1999
Actor-Critic Algorithms,"We propose and analyze a class of actor-critic algorithms for simulation-based optimization of a Markov decision process over a parameterized family of randomized stationary policies. These are two-time-scale algorithms in which the critic uses TD learning with a linear approximation architecture and the actor is updated in an approximate gradient direction based on information pro vided by the critic. We show that the features for the critic should span a subspace prescribed by the choice of parameterization of the actor. We conclude by discussing convergence properties and some open problems. 1 Introduction The vast majority of Reinforcement Learning (RL) [9J and Neuro-Dynamic Pro gramming (NDP) [lJ methods fall into one of the following two categories: (a) Actor-only methods work with a parameterized family of policies.

By ana lyzing the condition from the functional analytic point of view, we clarify the mechanism of achieving the optimal generalization capability. We also show that a set of training examples satisfying the condition does not only provide the optimal generalization but also reduces the compu tational complexity and memory required for the calculation of learning results. Finally, examples of sample points satisfying the condition are given and computer simulations are performed to demonstrate the effec tiveness of the proposed active learning method. 1 Introduction Supervised learning is obtaining an underlying rule from training examples, and can be formulated as a function approximation problem.

Image Recognition in Context: Application to,"We propose a new and efficient technique for incorporating contextual information into object classification. Most of the current techniques face the problem of exponential computation cost. In this paper, we propose a new general framework that incorporates partial context at a linear cost. This technique is applied to microscopic urinalysis image recognition, resulting in a significant improvement of recognition rate over the context free approach. This gain would have been impossible using conventional context incorporation techniques. 1 BACKGROUND: RECOGNITION IN CONTEXT There are a number of pattern recognition problem domains where the classification of an object should be based on more than simply the appearance of the object itself.

Bayesian Map Learning in Dynamic,"We consider the problem of learning a grid-based map using a robot with noisy sensors and actuators. We compare two approaches: online EM, where the map is treated as a fixed parameter, and Bayesian inference, where the map is a (matrix-valued) random variable. We show that even on a very simple example, online EM can get stuck in local minima, which causes the robot to get ""lost"" and the resulting map to be useless. By contrast, the Bayesian approach, by maintaining multiple hypotheses, is much more ro bust. We then introduce a method for approximating the Bayesian solution, called Rao-Blackwellised particle filtering. We show that this approximation, when coupled with an active learning strategy, is fast but accurate. 1 Introduction The problem of getting mobile robots to autonomously learn maps of their envi ronment has been widely studied (see e.g., [9] for a collection of recent papers).

Statistical Dynamics of Batch Learning,"An important issue in neural computing concerns the description of learning dynamics with macroscopic dynamical variables. Recen t progress on on-line learning only addresses the often unrealistic case of an infinite training set. We introduce a new framework to model batch learning of restricted sets of examples, widely applica ble to any learning cost function, and fully taking into account the temporal correlations introduced by the recycling of the examples. For illustration we analyze the effects of weight decay and early stopping during the learning of teacher-generated examples. 1 Introduction The dynamics of learning in neural computing is a complex multi-variate process. The interest on the macroscopic level is thus to describe the process with macro scopic dynamical variables.

Scale Mixtures of Gaussians and the,"The statistics of photographic images, when represented using multiscale (wavelet) bases, exhibit two striking types of non Gaussian behavior. First, the marginal densities of the coefficients have extended heavy tails. Second, the joint densities exhibit vari ance dependencies not captured by second-order models. We ex amine properties of the class of Gaussian scale mixtures, and show that these densities can accurately characterize both the marginal and joint distributions of natural image wavelet coefficients. This class of model suggests a Markov structure, in which wavelet coeffi cients are linked by hidden scaling variables corresponding to local image structure.

Independent Factor Analysis with,"We present a new technique for time series analysis based on dy namic probabilistic networks. In this approach, the observed data are modeled in terms of unobserved, mutually independent factors, as in the recently introduced technique of Independent Factor Anal ysis (IFA). However, unlike in IFA, the factors are not Li.d.; each factor has its own temporal statistical characteristics. We derive a family of EM algorithms that learn the structure of the underlying factors and their relation to the data. These algorithms perform source separation and noise reduction in an integrated manner, and demonstrate superior performance compared to IFA. 1 Introduction The technique of independent factor analysis (IFA) introduced in [1] provides a tool for modeling L'-dim data in terms of L unobserved factors.

Managing Uncertainty in Cue Combination,"We develop a hierarchical generative model to study cue combi nation. The model maps a global shape parameter to local cue specific parameters, which in tum generate an intensity image. Inferring shape from images is achieved by inverting this model. Inference produces a probability distribution at each level; using distributions rather than a single value of underlying variables at each stage preserves information about the validity of each local cue for the given image. This allows the model, unlike standard combination models, to adaptively weight each cue based on gen eral cue reliability and specific image context. We describe the results of a cue combination psychophysics experiment we con ducted that allows a direct comparison with the model. The model provides a good fit to our data and a natural account for some in teresting aspects of cue combination.

Potential Boosters ?,"Recent interpretations of the Adaboost algorithm view it as per forming a gradient descent on a potential function. Simply chang ing the potential function allows one to create new algorithms re lated to AdaBoost. However, these new algorithms are generally not known to have the formal boosting property. This paper ex amines the question of which potential functions lead to new al gorithms that are boosters. The two main results are general sets of conditions on the potential; one set implies that the resulting algorithm is a booster, while the other implies that the algorithm is not. These conditions are applied to previously studied potential functions, such as those used by LogitBoost and Doom II. 1 Introduction The first boosting algorithm appeared in Rob Schapire's thesis [1].

Simulations show that its spike trains exhibit resonant behavior between ""noise"" and ""delay"". In order to gain insight into this resonance, we simplify the model and study a stochastic binary element whose transition probability depends on its state at a fixed interval in the past. With this simplified model we can analytically compute interspike interval histograms, and show how the resonance between noise and delay arises. The resonance is also observed when such elements are coupled through delayed interaction. 1 Introd uction ""Noise"" and ""delay"" are two elements which are associated with many natural and artificial systems and have been studied in diverse fields.

Wiring optimization in the brain,"The complexity of cortical circuits may be characterized by the number of synapses per neuron. We study the dependence of complexity on the fraction of the cortical volume that is made up of ""wire"" (that is, ofaxons and dendrites), and find that complexity is maximized when wire takes up about 60% of the cortical volume. This prediction is in good agree ment with experimental observations. A consequence of our arguments is that any rearrangement of neurons that takes more wire would sacrifice computational power. Wiring a brain presents formidable problems because of the extremely large number of con nections: a microliter of cortex contains approximately 105 neurons, 109 synapses, and 4 km ofaxons, with 60% of the cortical volume being taken up with ""wire"", half of this by axons and the other half by dendrites.

Learning from user feedback in image retrieval,"We formulate the problem of retrieving images from visual databases as a problem of Bayesian inference. This leads to natural and effective solutions for two of the most challenging issues in the design of a retrieval system: providing support for region-based queries without requiring prior image segmentation, and accounting for user-feedback during a retrieval session. We present a new learning algorithm that relies on belief propagation to account for both positive and negative examples of the user's interests. 1 Introduction Due to the large amounts of imagery that can now be accessed and managed via comput ers, the problem of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has recently attracted significant interest among the vision community [1, 2, 5].

Online Independent Component Analysis,"Stochastic meta-descent (SMD) is a new technique for online adap tation of local learning rates in arbitrary twice-differentiable sys tems. Like matrix momentum it uses full second-order information while retaining O(n) computational complexity by exploiting the efficient computation of Hessian-vector products. Here we apply SMD to independent component analysis, and employ the result ing algorithm for the blind separation of time-varying mixtures. By matching individual learning rates to the rate of change in each source signal's mixture coefficients, our technique is capable of si multaneously tracking sources that move at very different, a priori unknown speeds. 1 Introduction Independent component analysis (ICA) methods are typically run in batch mode in order to keep the stochasticity of the empirical gradient low.

Algebraic Analysis for Non-Regular,"Hierarchical learning machines are non-regular and non-identifiable statistical models, whose true parameter sets are analytic sets with singularities. Using algebraic analysis, we rigorously prove that the stochastic complexity of a non-identifiable learning machine is asymptotically equal to >'1 log n - (ml - 1) log log n + const., where n is the number of training samples. Moreover we show that the rational number >'1 and the integer ml can be algorithmically calculated using resolution of singularities in algebraic geometry.

Inference for the Generalization Error,"In order to to compare learning algorithms, experimental results reported in the machine learning litterature often use statistical tests of signifi cance. Unfortunately, most of these tests do not take into account the variability due to the choice of training set. We perform a theoretical investigation of the variance of the cross-validation estimate of the gen eralization error that takes into account the variability due to the choice of training sets. This allows us to propose two new ways to estimate this variance. We show, via simulations, that these new statistics perform well relative to the statistics considered by Dietterich (Dietterich, 1998). 1 Introduction When applying a learning algorithm (or comparing several algorithms), one is typically interested in estimating its generalization error.

LTD Facilitates Learning In a Noisy,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) has long been held as a biological substrate for associative learning.

Here, the interaction between time-dependent LTP and LTD is studied in small networks. 1 Introduction Long term potentiation (LTP) is a neurophysiological phenomenon observed under laboratory conditions in which two neurons or neural populations are stimulated at a high frequency with a resulting measurable increase in synaptic efficacy between them that lasts for several hours or days [1]-[2] LTP thus provides direct evidence supporting the neurophysiological hypothesis articulated by Hebb [3].

An Oeulo-Motor System with Multi-Chip,"A system emulating the functionality of a moving eye-hence the name oculo-motor system-has been built and successfully tested. It is made of an optical device for shifting the field of view of an image sensor by up to 45 Â° in any direction, four neuromorphic analog VLSI circuits imple menting an oculo-motor control loop, and some off-the-shelf electronics. The custom integrated circuits communicate with each other primarily by non-arbitrated address-event buses. The system implements the behav iors of saliency-based saccadic exploration, and smooth pursuit of light spots. The duration of saccades ranges from 45 ms to 100 ms, which is comparable to human eye performance. Smooth pursuit operates on light sources moving at up to 500/s in the visual field. 1 INTRODUCTION Inspiration from biology has been recognized as a seminal approach to address some en gineering challenges, particularly in the computational domain [1].

Understanding stepwise generalization of,"In this article we study the effects of introducing structure in the input distribution of the data to be learnt by a simple perceptron. We determine the learning curves within the framework of Statis tical Mechanics. Stepwise generalization occurs as a function of the number of examples when the distribution of patterns is highly anisotropic. Although extremely simple, the model seems to cap ture the relevant features of a class of Support Vector Machines which was recently shown to present this behavior. 1 Introduction A new approach to learning has recently been proposed as an alternative to feedfor ward neural networks: the Support Vector Machines (SVM) [1]. Instead of trying to learn a non linear mapping between the input patterns and internal representations, like in multilayered perceptrons, the SVMs choose a priori a non-linear kernel that transforms the input space into a high dimensional feature space. In binary classi fication tasks like those considered in the present paper",Optimization & Theoretical ML,7eb7eabbe9bd03c2fc99881d04da9cbd-Paper.pdf,1999
A Geometric Interpretation of v-SVM,"We show that the recently proposed variant of the Support Vector machine (SVM) algorithm, known as v-SVM, can be interpreted as a maximal separation between subsets of the convex hulls of the data, which we call soft convex hulls. The soft convex hulls are controlled by choice of the parameter v. If the intersection of the convex hulls is empty, the hyperplane is positioned halfway between them such that the distance between convex hulls, measured along the normal, is maximized; and if it is not, the hyperplane's normal is similarly determined by the soft convex hulls, but its position (perpendicular distance from the origin) is adjusted to minimize the error sum. The proposed geometric interpretation of v-SVM also leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a choice of v for which the v-SVM solution is nontrivial. 1 Introduction Recently, SchOlkopf et al. [I) introduced a new class of SVM algorithms, called v-SVM, for both regression estimation and pattern recogn",Optimization & Theoretical ML,7fea637fd6d02b8f0adf6f7dc36aed93-Paper.pdf,1999
Robust Learning of Chaotic Attractors,"A fundamental problem with the modeling of chaotic time series data is that minimizing short-term prediction errors does not guarantee a match between the reconstructed attractors of model and experiments. We introduce a modeling paradigm that simultaneously learns to short-tenn predict and to locate the outlines of the attractor by a new way of nonlinear principal component analysis. Closed-loop predictions are constrained to stay within these outlines, to prevent divergence from the attractor. Learning is exceptionally fast: parameter estimation for the 1000 sample laser data from the 1991 Santa Fe time series competition took less than a minute on a 166 MHz Pentium PC. 1 Introduction We focus on the following objective: given a set of experimental data and the assumption that it was produced by a deterministic chaotic system, find a set of model equations that will produce a time-series with identical chaotic characteristics, having the same chaotic attractor.

Greedy importance sampling,"I present a simple variation of importance sampling that explicitly search es for important regions in the target distribution. I prove that the tech nique yields unbiased estimates, and show empirically it can reduce the variance of standard Monte Carlo estimators. This is achieved by con centrating samples in more significant regions of the sample space. 1 Introduction It is well known that general inference and learning with graphical models is computa tionally hard [1] and it is therefore necessary to consider restricted architectures [13], or approximate algorithms to perform these tasks [3, 7]. Among the most convenient and successful techniques are stochastic methods which are guaranteed to converge to a correct solution in the limit oflarge samples [10, 11, 12, 15]. These methods can be easily applied to complex inference problems that overwhelm deterministic approaches. The family of stochastic inference methods can be grouped into the independent Monte Carlo methods (importan",Optimization & Theoretical ML,8303a79b1e19a194f1875981be5bdb6f-Paper.pdf,1999
Recurrent cortical competition: Strengthen or,"We investigate the short term .dynamics of the recurrent competition and neural activity in the primary visual cortex in terms of information pro cessing and in the context of orientation selectivity. We propose that af ter stimulus onset, the strength of the recurrent excitation decreases due to fast synaptic depression. As a consequence, the network shifts from an initially highly nonlinear to a more linear operating regime. Sharp orientation tuning is established in the first highly competitive phase. In the second and less competitive phase, precise signaling of multiple ori entations and long range modulation, e.g., by intra- and inter-areal con nections becomes possible (surround effects). Thus the network first ex tracts the salient features from the stimulus, and then starts to process the details. We show that this signal processing strategy is optimal if the neurons have limited bandwidth and their objective is to transmit the maximum amount of information in any time interva",Computer Vision,831c2f88a604a07ca94314b56a4921b8-Paper.pdf,1999
Constrained Hidden Markov Models,"By thinking of each state in a hidden Markov model as corresponding to some spatial region of a fictitious topology space it is possible to naturally define neigh bouring states as those which are connected in that space. The transition matrix can then be constrained to allow transitions only between neighbours; this means that all valid state sequences correspond to connected paths in the topology space. I show how such constrained HMMs can learn to discover underlying structure in complex sequences of high dimensional data, and apply them to the problem of recovering mouth movements from acoustics in continuous speech. 1 Latent variable models for structured sequence data Structured time-series are generated by systems whose underlying state variables change in a continuous way but whose state to output mappings are highly nonlinear, many to one and not smooth.

Approximate inference algorithms for two-layer,"We present a class of approximate inference algorithms for graphical models of the QMR-DT type. We give convergence rates for these al gorithms and for the Jaakkola and Jordan (1999) algorithm, and verify these theoretical predictions empirically. We also present empirical re sults on the difficult QMR-DT network problem, obtaining performance of the new algorithms roughly comparable to the Jaakkola and Jordan algorithm. 1 Introduction The graphical models formalism provides an appealing framework for the design and anal ysis of network-based learning and inference systems. The formalism endows graphs with a joint probability distribution and interprets most queries of interest as marginal or con ditional probabilities under this joint. For a fixed model one is generally interested in the conditional probability of an output given an input (for prediction), or an input conditional on the output (for diagnosis or control).

Perceptual Organization Based on,"A figure-ground segregation network is proposed based on a novel boundary pair representation. Nodes in the network are bound ary segments obtained through local grouping. Each node is ex citatorily coupled with the neighboring nodes that belong to the same region, and inhibitorily coupled with the corresponding paired node. Gestalt grouping rules are incorporated by modulating con nections. The status of a node represents its probability being figural and is updated according to a differential equation. The system solves the figure-ground segregation problem through tem poral evolution. Different perceptual phenomena, such as modal and amodal completion, virtual contours, grouping and shape de composition are then explained through local diffusion. The system eliminates combinatorial optimization and accounts for many psy chophysical results with a fixed set of parameters. 1 Introduction Perceptual organization refers to the ability of grouping similar features in sensory data.

Learning Informative Statistics: A,"We discuss an information theoretic approach for categorizing and mod eling dynamic processes. The approach can learn a compact and informa tive statistic which summarizes past states to predict future observations. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the prediction is characterized nonpara metrically by a joint density over the learned statistic and present obser vation. We discuss the application of the technique to both noise driven dynamical systems and random processes sampled from a density which is conditioned on the past. In the first case we show results in which both the dynamics of random walk and the statistics of the driving noise are captured. In the second case we present results in which a summarizing statistic is learned on noisy random telegraph waves with differing de pendencies on past states. In both cases the algorithm yields a principled approach for discriminating processes with differing dynamics and/or de pendencies.

Rules and Similarity in Concept Learning,"This paper argues that two apparently distinct modes of generalizing con cepts - abstracting rules and computing similarity to exemplars - should both be seen as special cases of a more general Bayesian learning frame work. Bayes explains the specific workings of these two modes - which rules are abstracted, how similarity is measured - as well as why gener alization should appear rule- or similarity-based in different situations. This analysis also suggests why the rules/similarity distinction, even if not computationally fundamental, may still be useful at the algorithmic level as part of a principled approximation to fully Bayesian learning. 1 Introduction In domains ranging from reasoning to language acquisition, a broad view is emerging of cognition as a hybrid of two distinct modes of computation, one based on applying abstract rules and the other based on assessing similarity to stored exemplars [7]. Much support for this view comes from the study of concepts and categorization.",NLP,86d7c8a08b4aaa1bc7c599473f5dddda-Paper.pdf,1999
Support Vector Method for Novelty Detection,"Suppose you are given some dataset drawn from an underlying probabil ity distribution P and you want to estimate a ""simple"" subset S of input space such that the probability that a test point drawn from P lies outside of S equals some a priori specified l/ between 0 and 1. We propose a method to approach this problem by trying to estimate a function f which is positive on S and negative on the complement. The functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a poten tially small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of the weight vector in an associated feature space. We provide a theoretical analysis of the statistical performance of our algorithm. The algorithm is a natural extension of the support vector algorithm to the case of unlabelled data. 1 INTRODUCTION During recent years, a new set of kernel techniques for supervised learning has been devel oped [8].

Generalized Model Selection For Unsupervised,"We describe a Bayesian approach to model selection in unsupervised learning that determines both the feature set and the number of clusters. We then evaluate this scheme (based on marginal likelihood) and one based on cross-validated likelihood. For the Bayesian scheme we derive a closed-form solution of the marginal likelihood by assuming appropriate forms of the likelihood function and prior. Extensive experiments compare these approaches and all results are verified by comparison against ground truth. In these experiments the Bayesian scheme using our objective function gave better results than cross-validation. 1 Introduction Recent efforts define the model selection problem as one of estimating the number of clusters[ 10, 17].

The new criteria for testing optimality of a working set are derived. Based on these criteria, the principle of ""maximal inconsistency"" is pro posed to form (approximately) optimal working sets. Experimental results show superior performance of the new algorithm in compar ison with traditional training of regression SVM without decompo sition. Similar results have been previously reported on decomposi tion algorithms for pattern recognition SVM.

An Analog VLSI Model of,"This paper presents an electronic system that extracts the periodicity of a sound. It uses three analogue VLSI building blocks: a silicon cochlea, two inner-hair-cell circuits and two spiking neuron chips. The silicon cochlea consists of a cascade of filters. Because of the delay between two outputs from the silicon cochlea, spike trains created at these outputs are synchronous only for a narrow range of periodicities. In contrast to traditional band pass filters, where an increase in' selectivity has to be traded off against a decrease in response time, the proposed system responds quickly, independent of selectivity. 1 Introduction The human ear transduces airborne sounds into a neural signal using three stages in the inner ear's cochlea: (i) the mechanical filtering of the Basilar Membrane (BM), (ii) the transduction of membrane vibration into neurotransmitter release by the Inner Hair Cells (IHCs), and (iii) spike generation by the Spiral Ganglion Cells (SGCs), whose axons form the",Computer Vision,8b6a80c3cf2cbd5f967063618dc54f39-Paper.pdf,1999

We identify weak ergodicjty as the mechanism responsible for restriction of the computational power of probabilistic models to definite languages, independent of the characteristics of the noise: whether it is discrete or analog, or if it depends on the input or not, and independent of whether the variables are discrete or continuous. We give examples of weakly ergodic models including noisy computational systems with noise depending on the current state and inputs, aggregate models, and computational systems which update in continuous time. 1 Introduction Noisy neural networks were recently examined, e.g. in.

Experiments on several data sets from the UC Irvine repository demonstrate that DOOM II generally outperforms AdaBoost, especially in high noise situations, and that the overfitting behaviour of AdaBoost is predicted by our cost functions. 1 Introduction There has been considerable interest recently in voting methods for pattern classi fication, which predict the label of a particular example using a weighted vote over a set of base classifiers [10, 2, 6, 9, 16, 5, 3, 19, 12, 17, 7,",Optimization & Theoretical ML,96a93ba89a5b5c6c226e49b88973f46e-Paper.pdf,1999

Application of maximum likelihood estimation to this model gives a learning rule that is analogous to the binary Boltzmann machine. We examine the utility of the mean field approximation for the NNBM, and describe how Monte Carlo sampling techniques can be used to learn its parameters. Reflec tive slice sampling is particularly well-suited for this distribution, and can efficiently be implemented to sample the distribution. We illustrate learning of the NNBM on a transiationally invariant distribution, as well as on a generative model for images of human faces.

Here we set up a hierarchical probabilistic mixture model, where data is generated in a hierarchical tree-structured manner. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are demonstrated which can be used to sample from the posterior distribution over trees containing variable numbers of hidden units. 1 Introduction Over the past decade or two mixture models have become a popular approach to clustering or competitive learning problems. They have the advantage of having a well-defined ob jective function and fit in with the general trend of viewing neural network problems in a statistical framework. However, one disadvantage is that they produce a ""flat"" cluster struc ture rather than the hierarchical tree structure that is returned by some clustering algorithms such as the agglomerative single-link method (see e.g. [12]).

One of the simplest adaptive models is the factor analyzer, which is a two-layer network that models bottom layer sensory inputs as a linear combination of top layer factors plus in dependent Gaussian sensor noise. We show that local probability propagation in the factor analyzer network usually takes just a few iterations to perform accurate inference, even in networks with 320 sensors and 80 factors.

The Infinite Gaussian Mixture Model,"In a Bayesian mixture model it is not necessary a priori to limit the num ber of components to be finite. In this paper an infinite Gaussian mixture model is presented which neatly sidesteps the difficult problem of find ing the ""right"" number of mixture components. Inference in the model is done using an efficient parameter-free Markov Chain that relies entirely on Gibbs sampling. 1 Introduction One of the major advantages in the Bayesian methodology is that ""overfitting"" is avoided; thus the difficult task of adjusting model complexity vanishes. For neural networks, this was demonstrated by Neal [1996] whose work on infinite networks led to the reinvention and popularisation of Gaussian Process models [Williams & Rasmussen, 1996].

A particular case of this problem is multivariate regression, which is very difficult when the underlying mapping is one-to-many. We pro pose an algorithm based on a joint probability model of the variables of interest, implemented using a nonlinear latent variable model. Each point in the sequence is potentially reconstructed as any of the modes of the conditional distribution of the missing variables given the present variables (computed using an exhaustive mode search in a Gaussian mix ture).

Information Capacity and Robustness of,"The reliability and accuracy of spike trains have been shown to depend on the nature of the stimulus that the neuron encodes. Adding ion channel stochasticity to neuronal models results in a macroscopic behavior that replicates the input-dependent reliabili ty and precision of real neurons. We calculate the amount of infor mation that an ion channel based stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron model can encode about a wide set of stimuli. We show that both the information rate and the information per spike of the s tochastic model are similar to the values reported experimentally. Moreover, the amount of information that the neuron encodes is correlated with the amplitude of fluctuations in the input, and less so with the average firing rate of the neuron.

Bayesian Transduction,Transduction is an inference principle that takes a training sam ple and aims at estimating the values of a function at given points contained in the so-called working sample as opposed to the whole of input space for induction. Transduction provides a confidence measure on single predictions rather than classifiers - a feature particularly important for risk-sensitive applications. The possibly infinite number of functions is reduced to a finite number of equiv alence classes on the working sample.

The probability of the label of a given test point is determined as the posterior measure of the corresponding subset of hypothesis space.

Sta tistically similar variables are assigned to the same group. Each member's input set is then formed by input variables extracted from different groups. Our designed committees have less error cor relation between its members, since each member observes different input variable combinations.

Probabilistic methods for Support Vector,"I describe a framework for interpreting Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as maximum a posteriori (MAP) solutions to inference problems with Gaussian Process priors. This can provide intuitive guidelines for choosing a 'good' SVM kernel. It can also assign (by evidence maximization) optimal values to parameters such as the noise level C which cannot be determined unambiguously from properties of the MAP solution alone (such as cross-validation er ror).

Neural System Model of Human Sound,"This paper examines the role of biological constraints in the human audi tory localization process. A psychophysical and neural system modeling approach was undertaken in which performance comparisons between competing models and a human subject explore the relevant biologi cally plausible ""realism constraints"". The directional acoustical cues, upon which sound localization is based, were derived from the human subject's head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). Sound stimuli were generated by convolving bandpass noise with the HRTFs and were pre sented to both the subject and the model. The input stimuli to the model was processed using the Auditory Image Model of cochlear processing. The cochlear data was then analyzed by a time-delay neural network which integrated temporal and spectral information to determine the spa tial location of the sound source. The combined cochlear model and neural network provided a system model of the sound localization pro cess. Human-like localization p",Computer Vision,ab2b41c63853f0a651ba9fbf502b0cd8-Paper.pdf,1999
Graded grammaticality in Prediction,"We introduce a novel method of constructing language models, which avoids some of the problems associated with recurrent neu ral networks. The method of creating a Prediction Fractal Machine (PFM) [1] is briefly described and some experiments are presented which demonstrate the suitability of PFMs for language modeling. PFMs distinguish reliably between minimal pairs, and their be havior is consistent with the hypothesis [4] that wellformedness is 'graded' not absolute. A discussion of their potential to offer fresh insights into language acquisition and processing follows. 1 Introduction Cognitive linguistics has seen the development in recent years of two important, related trends. Firstly, a widespread renewal of interest in the statistical, 'graded' nature of language (e.g. [2]-[4]) is showing that the traditional all-or-nothing no tion of well-formedness may not present an accurate picture of how the congruity of utterances is represented internally. Secondly, the analysis of stat",NLP,ae614c557843b1df326cb29c57225459-Paper.pdf,1999
A Neuromorphic VLSI System for Modeling,"We have developed and tested an analog/digital VLSI system that mod els the coordination of biological segmental oscillators underlying axial locomotion in animals such as leeches and lampreys. In its current form the system consists of a chain of twelve pattern generating circuits that are capable of arbitrary contralateral inhibitory synaptic coupling. Each pattern generating circuit is implemented with two independent silicon Morris-Lecar neurons with a total of 32 programmable (floating-gate based) inhibitory synapses, and an asynchronous address-event inter connection element that provides synaptic connectivity and implements axonal delay. We describe and analyze the data from a set of experi ments exploring the system behavior in terms of synaptic coupling. 1 Introduction In recent years, neuroscientists and modelers have made great strides towards illuminat ing structure and computational properties in biological motor systems.

Learning sparse codes with a,"We describe a method for learning an overcomplete set of basis functions for the purpose of modeling sparse structure in images. The sparsity of the basis function coefficients is modeled with a mixture-of-Gaussians distribution. One Gaussian captures non active coefficients with a small-variance distribution centered at zero, while one or more other Gaussians capture active coefficients with a large-variance distribution. We show that when the prior is in such a form, there exist efficient methods for learning the basis functions as well as the parameters of the prior. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on a number of test cases and also on natural images. The basis functions learned on natural images are similar to those obtained with other methods, but the sparse form of the coefficient distribution is much better described. Also, since the parameters of the prior are adapted to the data, no assumption about sparse structure in the images need be made a priori, rather ",Computer Vision,b0f2ad44d26e1a6f244201fe0fd864d1-Paper.pdf,1999
Semiparametric Approach to Multichannel,"In this paper we discuss the semi parametric statistical model for blind deconvolution. First we introduce a Lie Group to the manifold of non causal FIR filters. Then blind deconvolution problem is formulated in the framework of a semiparametric model, and a family of estimating functions is derived for blind deconvolution. A natural gradient learn ing algorithm is developed for training noncausal filters. Stability of the natural gradient algorithm is also analyzed in this framework. 1 Introduction Recently blind separation/deconvolution has been recognized as an increasing important research area due to its rapidly growing applications in various fields, such as telecom munication systems, image enhancement and biomedical signal processing. Refer to re view papers [7] and [13] for details.

Application of Blind Separation of Sources to,"In the analysis of data recorded by optical imaging from intrinsic signals (measurement of changes of light reflectance from cortical tissue) the re moval of noise and artifacts such as blood vessel patterns is a serious problem. Often bandpass filtering is used, but the underlying assumption that a spatial frequency exists, which separates the mapping component from other components (especially the global signal), is questionable. Here we propose alternative ways of processing optical imaging data, us ing blind source separation techniques based on the spatial decorre1ation of the data. We first perform benchmarks on artificial data in order to select the way of processing, which is most robust with respect to sen sor noise. We then apply it to recordings of optical imaging experiments from macaque primary visual cortex.

Spectral Cues in Human Sound Localization,"The differential contribution of the monaural and interaural spectral cues to human sound localization was examined using a combined psy chophysical and analytical approach. The cues to a sound's location were correlated on an individual basis with the human localization re sponses to a variety of spectrally manipulated sounds. The spectral cues derive from the acoustical filtering of an individual's auditory periphery which is characterized by the measured head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). Auditory localization performance was determined in virtual auditory space (VAS). Psychoacoustical experiments were conducted in which the amplitude spectra of the sound stimulus was varied indepen dentlyat each ear while preserving the normal timing cues, an impossibil ity in the free-field environment. Virtual auditory noise stimuli were gen erated over earphones for a specified target direction such that there was a ""false"" flat spectrum at the left eardrum.

Robust Full Bayesian Methods for Neural,"In this paper, we propose a full Bayesian model for neural networks. This model treats the model dimension (number of neurons), model parameters, regularisation parameters and noise parameters as ran dom variables that need to be estimated. We then propose a re versible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to per form the necessary computations. We find that the results are not only better than the previously reported ones, but also appear to be robust with respect to the prior specification. Moreover, we present a geometric convergence theorem for the algorithm. 1 Introduction In the early nineties, Buntine and Weigend (1991) and Mackay (1992) showed that a principled Bayesian learning approach to neural networks can lead to many improve ments [1,2].

A Neurodynamical Approach to Visual Attention,"The psychophysical evidence for ""selective attention"" originates mainly from visual search experiments. In this work, we formulate a hierarchi cal system of interconnected modules consisting in populations of neu rons for modeling the underlying mechanisms involved in selective visual attention. We demonstrate that our neural system for visual search works across the visual field in parallel but due to the different intrinsic dynamics can show the two experimentally observed modes of visual attention, namely: the serial and the parallel search mode. In other words, neither explicit model of a focus of attention nor saliencies maps are used. The focus of attention appears as an emergent property of the dynamic behavior of the system. The neural population dynamics are handled in the framework of the mean-field approximation. Conse quently, the whole process can be expressed as a system of coupled dif ferential equations. 1 Introduction Traditional theories of human vision considers two ",Computer Vision,b3bbccd6c008e727785cb81b1aa08ac5-Paper.pdf,1999
Dynamics of Supervised Learning with,"We generalize a recent formalism to describe the dynamics of supervised learning in layered neural networks, in the regime where data recycling is inevitable, to the case of noisy teachers. Our theory generates reliable predictions for the evolution in time of training- and generalization er rors, and extends the class of mathematically solvable learning processes in large neural networks to those situations where overfitting can occur. 1 Introduction Tools from statistical mechanics have been used successfully over the last decade to study the dynamics of learning in layered neural networks (for reviews see e.g. [1] or [2]). The simplest theories result upon assuming the data set to be much larger than the number of weight updates made, which rules out recycling and ensures that any distribution of relevance will be Gaussian. Unfortunately, both in terms of applications and in terms of mathematical interest, this regime is not the most relevant one.

Audio-Vision:,"Psychophysical and physiological evidence shows that sound local ization of acoustic signals is strongly influenced by their synchrony with visual signals. This effect, known as ventriloquism, is at work when sound coming from the side of a TV set feels as if it were coming from the mouth of the actors. The ventriloquism effect suggests that there is important information about sound location encoded in the synchrony between the audio and video signals. In spite of this evidence, audiovisual synchrony is rarely used as a source of information in computer vision tasks. In this paper we explore the use of audio visual synchrony to locate sound sources. We developed a system that searches for regions of the visual land scape that correlate highly with the acoustic signals and tags them as likely to contain an acoustic source. We discuss our experience implementing the system, present results on a speaker localization task and discuss potential applications of the approach.

Predictive Sequence Learning in Recurrent,Neocortical circuits are dominated by massive excitatory feedback: more than eighty percent of the synapses made by excitatory cortical neurons are onto other excitatory cortical neurons. Why is there such massive re current excitation in the neocortex and what is its role in cortical compu tation? Recent neurophysiological experiments have shown that the plas ticity of recurrent neocortical synapses is governed by a temporally asym metric Hebbian learning rule. We describe how such a rule may allow the cortex to modify recurrent synapses for prediction of input sequences. The goal is to predict the next cortical input from the recent past based on previous experience of similar input sequences. We show that a temporal difference learning rule for prediction used in conjunction with dendritic back-propagating action potentials reproduces the temporally asymmet ric Hebbian plasticity observed physiologically.

Differentiating Functions of the Jacobian,"For many problems, the correct behavior of a model depends not only on its input-output mapping but also on properties of its Jacobian matrix, the matrix of partial derivatives of the model's outputs with respect to its in puts. We introduce the J-prop algorithm, an efficient general method for computing the exact partial derivatives of a variety of simple functions of the Jacobian of a model with respect to its free parameters. The algorithm applies to any parametrized feedforward model, including nonlinear re gression, multilayer perceptrons, and radial basis function networks. 1 Introduction Let f (x, w) be an n input, m output, twice differentiable feedforward model parameterized by an input vector, x, and a weight vector w.

Effects of Spatial and Temporal Contiguity on,"Spatial information comes in two forms: direct spatial information (for example, retinal position) and indirect temporal contiguity information, since objects encountered sequentially are in general spatially close. The acquisition of spatial information by a neural network is investigated here. Given a spatial layout of several objects, networks are trained on a prediction task. Networks using temporal sequences with no direct spa tial information are found to develop internal representations that show distances correlated with distances in the external layout. The influence of spatial information is analyzed by providing direct spatial information to the system during training that is either consistent with the layout or inconsistent with it. This approach allows examination of the relative contributions of spatial and temporal contiguity. 1 Introduction Spatial information is acquired by a process of exploration that is fundamentally tempo ral, whether it be on a small scale, such a",Computer Vision,ba1b3eba322eab5d895aa3023fe78b9c-Paper.pdf,1999
Agglomerative Information Bottleneck,"We introduce a novel distributional clustering algorithm that max imizes the mutual information per cluster between data and giv en categories.

Spike-based learning rules and stabilization of,"We analyze the conditions under which synaptic learning rules based on action potential timing can be approximated by learning rules based on firing rates. In particular, we consider a form of plasticity in which synapses depress when a presynaptic spike is followed by a postsynaptic spike, and potentiate with the opposite temporal ordering. Such differen tial anti-Hebbian plasticity can be approximated under certain conditions by a learning rule that depends on the time derivative of the postsynaptic firing rate. Such a learning rule acts to stabilize persistent neural activity patterns in recurrent neural networks. 1 INTRODUCTION Recent experiments have demonstrated types of synaptic plasticity that depend on the o~i =~=::====: ~re 11111111111 111111111111111111 11. temporal ordering of presynap A post 11111111111 11111111 â¢â¢ _:3/_-----' tic and postsynaptic spiking.

Nonlinear Discriminant Analysis using,"Fishers linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a classical multivari ate technique both for dimension reduction and classification. The data vectors are transformed into a low dimensional subspace such that the class centroids are spread out as much as possible. In this subspace LDA works as a simple prototype classifier with lin ear decision boundaries. However, in many applications the linear boundaries do not adequately separate the classes.

On input selection with reversible jump,"In this paper we will treat input selection for a radial basis function (RBF) like classifier within a Bayesian framework. We approximate the a-posteriori distribution over both model coefficients and input subsets by samples drawn with Gibbs updates and reversible jump moves. Using some public datasets, we compare the classification accuracy of the method with a conventional ARD scheme. These datasets are also used to infer the a-posteriori probabilities of dif ferent input subsets. 1 Introduction Methods that aim to determine relevance of inputs have always interested re searchers in various communities. Classical feature subset selection techniques, as reviewed in [1], use search algorithms and evaluation criteria to determine one opti mal subset.

Uniqueness of the SVM Solution,"We give necessary and sufficient conditions for uniqueness of the support vector solution for the problems of pattern recognition and regression estimation, for a general class of cost functions. We show that if the solution is not unique, all support vectors are necessarily at bound, and we give some simple examples of non-unique solu tions. We note that uniqueness of the primal (dual) solution does not necessarily imply uniqueness of the dual (primal) solution. We show how to compute the threshold b when the solution is unique, but when all support vectors are at bound, in which case the usual method for determining b does not work. 1 Introduction Support vector machines (SVMs) have attracted wide interest as a means to imple ment structural risk minimization for the problems of classification and regression estimation.

The mutual information (MI) between the pho netic label and one feature, and the joint mutual information (JMI) between the phonetic label and two or three features are estimated. The Miller's bias formulas for entropy and mutual information es timates are extended to include higher order terms. The MI and the JMI for speaker/channel recognition are also estimated. The results are complementary to those for phonetic classification. Our results show how the phonetic information is locally spread and how the speaker/channel information is globally spread in time and frequency. 1 Introduction Speech signals typically carry information about number of target sources such as linguistic message, speaker identity, and environment in which the speech was produced.

An Oscillatory Correlation Framework for,"A neural model is described which uses oscillatory correlation to segregate speech from interfering sound sources. The core of the model is a two-layer neural oscillator network. A sound stream is represented by a synchronized population of oscillators, and different streams are represented by desynchronized oscillator populations. The model has been evaluated using a corpus of speech mixed with interfering sounds, and produces an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio for every mixture. 1 Introduction Speech is seldom heard in isolation: usually, it is mixed with other environmental sounds. Hence, the auditory system must parse the acoustic mixture reaching the ears in order to retrieve a description of each sound source, a process termed auditory scene analysis (ASA) [2]. Conceptually, ASA may be regarded as a two-stage process. The first stage (which we term 'segmentation') decomposes the acoustic stimulus into a collection of sensory elements.

Speech Modelling Using Subspace and EM,"The speech waveform can be modelled as a piecewise-stationary linear stochastic state space system, and its parameters can be estimated using an expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. One problem is the ini tialisation of the EM algorithm. Standard initialisation schemes can lead to poor formant trajectories. But these trajectories however are impor tant for vowel intelligibility. The aim of this paper is to investigate the suitability of subspace identification methods to initialise EM. The paper compares the subspace state space system identification (4SID) method with the EM algorithm. The 4SID and EM methods are similar in that they both estimate a state sequence (but using Kalman fil ters and Kalman smoothers respectively), and then estimate parameters (but using least-squares and maximum likelihood respectively). The sim ilarity of 4SID and EM motivates the use of 4SID to initialise EM.

Optimal Kernel Shapes for Local Linear,"Local linear regression performs very well in many low-dimensional forecasting problems. In high-dimensional spaces, its performance typically decays due to the well-known ""curse-of-dimensionality"". A possible way to approach this problem is by varying the ""shape"" of the weighting kernel. In this work we suggest a new, data-driven method to estimating the optimal kernel shape. Experiments us ing an artificially generated data set and data from the UC Irvine repository show the benefits of kernel shaping. 1 Introduction Local linear regression has attracted considerable attention in both statistical and machine learning literature as a flexible tool for nonparametric regression analysis [Cle79, FG96, AMS97].

Robust Neural Network Regression for Offline,"We replace the commonly used Gaussian noise model in nonlinear regression by a more flexible noise model based on the Student-t distribution. The degrees of freedom of the t-distribution can be chosen such that as special cases either the Gaussian distribution or the Cauchy distribution are realized. The latter is commonly used in robust regres sion. Since the t-distribution can be interpreted as being an infinite mix ture of Gaussians, parameters and hyperparameters such as the degrees of freedom of the t-distribution can be learned from the data based on an EM-learning algorithm. We show that modeling using the t-distribution leads to improved predictors on real world data sets. In particular, if outliers are present, the t-distribution is superior to the Gaussian noise model. In effect, by adapting the degrees of freedom, the system can ""learn"" to distinguish between outliers and non-outliers.

Coastal Navigation with Mobile Robots,"The problem that we address in this paper is how a mobile robot can plan in order to arrive at its goal with minimum uncertainty. Traditional motion planning algo rithms often assume that a mobile robot can track its position reliably, however, in real world situations, reliable localization may not always be feasible. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide one way to maximize the certainty of reaching the goal state, but at the cost of computational intractability for large state spaces. The method we propose explicitly models the uncertainty of the robot's position as a state variable, and generates trajectories through the augmented pose-uncertainty space. By minimizing the positional uncertainty at the goal, the robot reduces the likelihood it becomes lost. We demonstrate experimentally that coastal navigation reduces the uncertainty at the goal, especially with degraded localization. 1 Introduction For an operational mobile robot, it is essential to preven",Computer Vision,df9028fcb6b065e000ffe8a4f03eeb38-Paper.pdf,1999
Boosting with Multi-Way Branching in,"It is known that decision tree learning can be viewed as a form of boosting. However, existing boosting theorems for decision tree learning allow only binary-branching trees and the generalization to multi-branching trees is not immediate.

Here we give a boosting justifica tion for a particular quantitative trade-off curve. Our main theorem states, in essence, that if we require an improvement proportional to the log of the number of branches then top-down greedy con struction of decision trees remains an effective boosting algorithm. 1 Introduction Decision trees have been proved to be a very popular tool in experimental machine learning.

It was shown that when training data are separable, the error rate for SVMs can be characterized by (1) where R is the radius ofthe smallest sphere containing the training data and M is the mar gin (the distance between the hyperplane and the closest training vector in feature space).

The aim of our present work is to quantify this boost by estimating the capacity of (1) a neuron model with passive den dritic integration where inputs are combined linearly across the entire cell followed by a single global threshold, and (2) an active dendrite model in which a threshold is applied separately to the output of each branch, and the branch subtotals are combined lin early. We focus here on the limiting case of binary-valued synaptic weights, and derive expressions which measure model capacity by estimating the number of distinct input-output functions available to both neuron types. We show that (1) the application of a fixed nonlinearity to each dendritic compartment substantially increases the model's flexibility, (2) for a neuron of realistic size, the capacity of ",Computer Vision,e4873aa9a05cc5ed839561d121516766-Paper.pdf,1999
State Abstraction in MAXQ Hierarchical,"Many researchers have explored methods for hierarchical reinforce ment learning (RL) with temporal abstractions, in which abstract actions are defined that can perform many primitive actions before terminating. However, little is known about learning with state ab stractions, in which aspects of the state space are ignored. In previ ous work, we developed the MAXQ method for hierarchical RL. In this paper, we define five conditions under which state abstraction can be combined with the MAXQ value function decomposition. We prove that the MAXQ-Q learning algorithm converges under these conditions and show experimentally that state abstraction is important for the successful application of MAXQ-Q learning. 1 Introduction Most work on hierarchical reinforcement learning has focused on temporal abstrac tion. For example, in the Options framework [1,2], the programmer defines a set of macro actions (""options"") and provides a policy for each.

Modeling High-Dimensional Discrete Data with,"The curse of dimensionality is severe when modeling high-dimensional discrete data: the number of possible combinations of the variables ex plodes exponentially. In this paper we propose a new architecture for modeling high-dimensional data that requires resources (parameters and computations) that grow only at most as the square of the number of vari ables, using a multi-layer neural network to represent the joint distribu tion of the variables as the product of conditional distributions. The neu ral network can be interpreted as a graphical model without hidden ran dom variables, but in which the conditional distributions are tied through the hidden units. The connectivity of the neural network can be pruned by using dependency tests between the variables. Experiments on modeling the distribution of several discrete data sets show statistically significant improvements over other methods such as naive Bayes and comparable Bayesian networks, and show that significant improvements can ",Computer Vision,e6384711491713d29bc63fc5eeb5ba4f-Paper.pdf,1999
A generative model for attractor dynamics,"Attractor networks, which map an input space to a discrete out put space, are useful for pattern completion. However, designing a net to have a given set of attractors is notoriously tricky; training procedures are CPU intensive and often produce spurious afuac tors and ill-conditioned attractor basins. These difficulties occur because each connection in the network participates in the encod ing of multiple attractors. We describe an alternative formulation of attractor networks in which the encoding of knowledge is local, not distributed. Although localist attractor networks have similar dynamics to their distributed counterparts, they are much easier to work with and interpret. We propose a statistical formulation of localist attract or net dynamics, which yields a convergence proof and a mathematical interpretation of model parameters. Attractor networks map an input space, usually continuous, to a sparse output space composed of a discrete set of alternatives.

An Environment Model for N onstationary,"Reinforcement learning in nonstationary environments is generally regarded as an important and yet difficult problem. This paper partially addresses the problem by formalizing a subclass of nonsta tionary environments. The environment model, called hidden-mode Markov decision process (HM-MDP), assumes that environmental changes are always confined to a small number of hidden modes. A mode basically indexes a Markov decision process (MDP) and evolves with time according to a Markov chain. While HM-MDP is a special case of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP), modeling an HM-MDP environment via the more gen eral POMDP model unnecessarily increases the problem complex ity. A variant of the Baum-Welch algorithm is developed for model learning requiring less data and time. 1 Introduction Reinforcement Learning (RL) [7] is a learning paradigm based upon the framework of Markov decision process (MDP).

Predictive Approaches For Choosing,"Gaussian Processes are powerful regression models specified by parametrized mean and covariance functions. Standard approaches to estimate these parameters (known by the name Hyperparam eters) are Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum APosterior (MAP) approaches. In this paper, we propose and investigate pre dictive approaches, namely, maximization of Geisser's Surrogate Predictive Probability (GPP) and minimization of mean square er ror with respect to GPP (referred to as Geisser's Predictive mean square Error (GPE)) to estimate the hyperparameters. We also derive results for the standard Cross-Validation (CV) error and make a comparison. These approaches are tested on a number of problems and experimental results show that these approaches are strongly competitive to existing approaches. 1 Introduction Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful regression models that have gained popular ity recently, though they have appeared in different forms in the literature for years.

Acquisition in Autoshaping,"Quantitative data on the speed with which animals acquire behav ioral responses during classical conditioning experiments should provide strong constraints on models of learning. However, most models have simply ignored these data; the few that have attempt ed to address them have failed by at least an order of magnitude. We discuss key data on the speed of acquisition, and show how to account for them using a statistically sound model of learning, in which differential reliabilities of stimuli playa crucial role. 1 Introduction Conditioning experiments probe the ways that animals make predictions about rewards and punishments and how those predictions are used to their advantage. Substantial quantitative data are available as to how pigeons and rats acquire con ditioned responses during autoshaping, which is one of the simplest paradigms of classical conditioning.4 These data are revealing about the statistical, and ulti mately also the neural, substrate underlying the ways that anima",Optimization & Theoretical ML,e9b73bccd1762555582b513ff9d02492-Paper.pdf,1999

We demonstrate that this direct (transduc ti ve) way for estimating values of the regression (or classification in pattern recognition) can be more accurate than the tradition alone based on two steps, first estimating the function and then calculating the values of this function at the points of interest. 1 Introduction Following [6] we consider a general scheme of transductive inference.

Effective Learning Requires Neuronal,"This paper revisits the classical neuroscience paradigm of Hebbian learning. We find that a necessary requirement for effective as sociative memory learning is that the efficacies of the incoming synapses should be uncorrelated. This requirement is difficult to achieve in a robust manner by Hebbian synaptic learning, since it depends on network level information. Effective learning can yet be obtained by a neuronal process that maintains a zero sum of the in coming synaptic efficacies. This normalization drastically improves the memory capacity of associative networks, from an essentially bounded capacity to one that linearly scales with the network's size. It also enables the effective storage of patterns with heterogeneous coding levels in a single network. Such neuronal normalization can be successfully carried out by activity-dependent homeostasis of the neuron's synaptic efficacies, which was recently observed in cortical tissue. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that effective ",NLP,f0bda020d2470f2e74990a07a607ebd9-Paper.pdf,1999
The Relevance Vector Machine,"The support vector machine (SVM) is a state-of-the-art technique for regression and classification, combining excellent generalisation properties with a sparse kernel representation. However, it does suffer from a number of disadvantages, notably the absence of prob abilistic outputs, the requirement to estimate a trade-off parameter and the need to utilise 'Mercer' kernel functions. In this paper we introduce the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), a Bayesian treat ment of a generalised linear model of identical functional form to the SVM. The RVM suffers from none of the above disadvantages, and examples demonstrate that for comparable generalisation per formance, the RVM requires dramatically fewer kernel functions. 1 Introd uction In supervised learning we are given a set of examples of input vectors {Xn}~=l along with corresponding targets {tn}~=l' the latter of which might be real values (in regression) or class labels (classification).

Learning Statistically Neutral Tasks,"In this paper, we question the necessity of levels of expert-guided tasks. We focus on two tasks, date calculation and parity-12, that are claimed to require intermediate levels of abstraction that must be defined by a human expert. We challenge this claim by demon strating empirically that a single hidden-layer BP-SOM network can learn both tasks without guidance. Moreover, we analyze the net work's solution for the parity-12 task and show that its solution makes use of an elegant intermediary checksum computation. 1 Introduction Breaking up a complex task into many smaller and simpler subtasks facilitates its solution. Such task decomposition has proved to be a successful technique in developing algorithms and in building theories of cognition. In their study and modeling of the human problem-solving process, Newell and Simon [1] employed protocol analysis to determine the subtasks human subjects employ in solving a complex task.

Dual Estimation and the Unscented,"Dual estimation refers to the problem of simultaneously estimating the state of a dynamic system and the model which gives rise to the dynam ics. Algorithms include expectation-maximization (EM), dual Kalman filtering, and joint Kalman methods. These methods have recently been explored in the context of nonlinear modeling, where a neural network is used as the functional form of the unknown model. Typically, an ex tended Kalman filter (EKF) or smoother is used for the part of the al gorithm that estimates the clean state given the current estimated model. An EKF may also be used to estimate the weights of the network. This paper points out the flaws in using the EKF, and proposes an improve ment based on a new approach called the unscented transformation (UT) [3]. A substantial performance gain is achieved with the same order of computational complexity as that of the standard EKF. The approach is illustrated on several dual estimation methods. 1 Introduction We consider the problem of",Optimization & Theoretical ML,f50a6c02a3fc5a3a5d4d9391f05f3efc-Paper.pdf,1999
Correctness of belief propagation in Gaussian,"Local ""belief propagation"" rules of the sort proposed by Pearl [15] are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities in singly connected graphical models. Recently, a number of researchers have em pirically demonstrated good performance of ""loopy belief propagation"" using these same rules on graphs with loops. Perhaps the most dramatic instance is the near Shannon-limit performance of ""Turbo codes"", whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy belief propagation. Except for the case of graphs with a single loop, there has been little theo retical understanding of the performance of loopy propagation. Here we analyze belief propagation in networks with arbitrary topologies when the nodes in the graph describe jointly Gaussian random variables. We give an analytical formula relating the true posterior probabilities with those calculated using loopy propagation.

A Multi-class Linear Learning Algorithm,"In this paper, we present Committee, a new multi-class learning algo rithm related to the Winnow family of algorithms.

A sub-expert is a special type of attribute that predicts with a distribution over a finite number of classes. Committee learns a linear function of sub-experts and uses this function to make class predictions. We provide bounds for Committee that show it performs well when the target can be represented by a few relevant sub-experts. We also show how Committee can be used to solve more traditional problems composed of attributes. This leads to a natural ex tension that learns on multi-class problems that contain both traditional attributes and sub-experts. 1 Introduction In this paper, we present a new multi-class learning algorithm called Committee.

Recognizing Evoked Potentials in a Virtual,"Virtual reality (VR) provides immersive and controllable experimen tal environments.

In order to test the feasibility of on-line recognition in VR, we looked at recognizing the P3 EP at red stop tights and the absence of this signal at yellow slow down lights.

Reinforcement Learning with Function,"Many algorithms for approximate reinforcement learning are not known to converge. In fact, there are counterexamples showing that the adjustable weights in some algorithms may oscillate within a region rather than converging to a point. This paper shows that, for two popular algorithms, such oscillation is the worst that can happen: the weights cannot diverge, but instead must converge to a bounded region. The algorithms are SARSA(O) and V(O); the latter algorithm was used in the well-known TD-Gammon program. 1 Introduction Although there are convergent online algorithms (such as TD()') [1]) for learning the parameters of a linear approximation to the value function of a Markov process, no way is known to extend these convergence proofs to the task of online approxi mation of either the state-value (V*) or the action-value (Q*) function of a general Markov decision process.

Redundancy and Dimensionality Reduction in,"Low-dimensional representations are key to solving problems in high level vision, such as face compression and recognition. Factorial coding strategies for reducing the redundancy present in natural images on the basis of their second-order statistics have been successful in account ing for both psychophysical and neurophysiological properties of early vision. Class-specific representations are presumably formed later, at the higher-level stages of cortical processing. Here we show that when retinotopic factorial codes are derived for ensembles of natural objects, such as human faces, not only redundancy, but also dimensionality is re duced. We also show that objects are built from parts in a non-Gaussian fashion which allows these local-feature codes to have dimensionalities that are substantially lower than the respective Nyquist sampling rates. 1 Introduction Sensory systems must take advantage of the statistical structure of their inputs in order to process them efficiently, both t",Computer Vision,052335232b11864986bb2fa20fa38748-Paper.pdf,2000

"Overfitting in Neural Nets: Backpropagation,","The conventional wisdom is that backprop nets with excess hidden units generalize poorly. We show that nets with excess capacity generalize well when trained with backprop and early stopping. Experiments sug gest two reasons for this: 1) Overfitting can vary significantly in different regions of the model. Excess capacity allows better fit to regions of high non-linearity, and backprop often avoids overfitting the regions of low non-linearity. 2) Regardless of size, nets learn task subcomponents in similar sequence. Big nets pass through stages similar to those learned by smaller nets. Early stopping can stop training the large net when it generalizes comparably to a smaller net. We also show that conjugate gradient can yield worse generalization because it overfits regions of low non-linearity when learning to fit regions of high non-linearity. 1 Introduction It is commonly believed that large multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) generalize poorly: nets with too much capacity overfit the tr",Optimization & Theoretical ML,059fdcd96baeb75112f09fa1dcc740cc-Paper.pdf,2000
Color Opponency Constitutes A Sparse,"The human visual system encodes the chromatic signals conveyed by the three types of retinal cone photoreceptors in an opponent fashion. This color opponency has been shown to constitute an efficient encoding by spectral decorrelation of the receptor signals. We analyze the spatial and chromatic structure of natural scenes by decomposing the spectral images into a set of linear basis functions such that they constitute a representation with minimal redun dancy. Independent component analysis finds the basis functions that transforms the spatiochromatic data such that the outputs (activations) are statistically as independent as possible, i.e. least redundant. The resulting basis functions show strong opponency along an achromatic direction (luminance edges), along a blue yellow direction, and along a red-blue direction. Furthermore, the resulting activations have very sparse distributions, suggesting that the use of color opponency in the human visual system achieves a highly efficient",Computer Vision,0609154fa35b3194026346c9cac2a248-Paper.pdf,2000
Learning Segmentation by Random Walks,"We present a new view of image segmentation by pairwise simi larities. We interpret the similarities as edge flows in a Markov random walk and study the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the walk's transition matrix. This interpretation shows that spectral methods for clustering and segmentation have a probabilistic foun dation. In particular, we prove that the Normalized Cut method arises naturally from our framework. Finally, the framework pro vides a principled method for learning the similarity function as a combination of features. 1 Introduction This paper focuses on pairwise (or similarity-based) clustering and image segmen tation. In contrast to statistical clustering methods, that assume a probabilistic model that generates the observed data points (or pixels), pairwise clustering de fines a similarity function between pairs of points and then formulates a criterion (e.g. maximum total intracluster similarity) that the clustering must optimize.

A PAC-Bayesian Margin Bound for Linear,"We present a bound on the generalisation error of linear classifiers in terms of a refined margin quantity on the training set. The result is obtained in a PAC-Bayesian framework and is based on geometrical arguments in the space of linear classifiers. The new bound constitutes an exponential improvement of the so far tightest margin bound by Shawe-Taylor et al. [8] and scales logarithmically in the inverse margin. Even in the case of less training examples than input dimensions sufficiently large margins lead to non-trivial bound values and - for maximum margins - to a vanishing com plexity term. Furthermore, the classical margin is too coarse a measure for the essential quantity that controls the generalisation error: the volume ratio between the whole hypothesis space and the subset of consistent hypotheses. The practical relevance of the result lies in the fact that the well-known support vector machine is optimal w.r.t. the new bound only if the feature vectors are all of the same",Optimization & Theoretical ML,06a15eb1c3836723b53e4abca8d9b879-Paper.pdf,2000
Active Learning for Parameter Estimation,"Bayesian networks are graphical representations of probability distributions. In virtually all of the work on learning these networks, the assumption is that we are presented with a data set consisting of randomly generated instances from the underlying distribution. In many situations, however, we also have the option of active learning, where we have the possibility of guiding the sampling process by querying for certain types of samples.

We provide a theoretical framework for this problem, and an algorithm that chooses which active learning queries to generate based on the model learned so far. We present experimental results showing that our active learning algorithm can significantly reduce the need for training data in many situations. 1 Introduction In many machine learning applications, the most time-consuming and costly task is the collection of a sufficiently larg",Optimization & Theoretical ML,0731460a8a5ce1626210cbf4385ae0ef-Paper.pdf,2000

Additionally we show the rough outline how this bound is applicable to sigmoid belief networks. Numerical experiments in dicate that an error reduction of a factor two is easily reached in the region where expansion based approximations are useful. 1 Introduction Graphical models have the capability to model a large class of probability distri butions. The neurons in these networks are the random variables, whereas the connections between them model the causal dependencies.

The two views are reconciled when measuring complexity of functions, rather than of the machinery used to implement them. We analyze the complexity of functions for some linear in the parameter models that are equivalent to Gaussian Processes, and always find Occam's Razor at work. 1 Introduction Occam's Razor is a well known principle of ""parsimony of explanations"" which is influen tial in scientific thinking in general and in problems of statistical inference in particular.

The underlying model con sists of a network of input units driving a larger number of output units with recurrent interactions.

Maximizing this entropy with respect to both the feed forward connections as well as the recurrent interactions results in simple learning rules for both sets of parameters.

A Linear Programming Approach to,Novelty detection involves modeling the normal behaviour of a sys tem hence enabling detection of any divergence from normality. It has potential applications in many areas such as detection of ma chine damage or highlighting abnormal features in medical data. One approach is to build a hypothesis estimating the support of the normal data i.e. constructing a function which is positive in the region where the data is located and negative elsewhere. Recently kernel methods have been proposed for estimating the support of a distribution and they have performed well in practice - training involves solution of a quadratic programming problem. In this pa per we propose a simpler kernel method for estimating the support based on linear programming. The method is easy to implement and can learn large datasets rapidly.

Convergence of Large Margin Separable Linear,"Large margin linear classification methods have been successfully ap plied to many applications. For a linearly separable problem, it is known that under appropriate assumptions, the expected misclassification error of the computed ""optimal hyperplane"" approaches zero at a rate propor tional to the inverse training sample size. This rate is usually charac terized by the margin and the maximum norm of the input data. In this paper, we argue that another quantity, namely the robustness of the in put data distribution, also plays an important role in characterizing the convergence behavior of expected misclassification error. Based on this concept of robustness, we show that for a large margin separable linear classification problem, the expected misclassification error may converge exponentially in the number of training sample size. 1 Introduction We consider the binary classification problem: to determine a label y E {-1, 1} associ ated with an input vector x.

This algorithm when trained on natural video sequences develops bases representing the movement in particular directions with particular speeds, similar to the receptive fields of the movement-sensitive cells observed in cortical visual areas. Furthermore, in contrast to previous approaches to learning direction selectivity, the timing of neuronal activity encodes the phase of the movement, so the precise timing of spikes is crucially important to the information encoding. 1 Introduction It was suggested by Barlow [3] that the goal of early sensory processing is to reduce redundancy in sensory information and the activity of sen",Computer Vision,136f951362dab62e64eb8e841183c2a9-Paper.pdf,2000
High-temperature expansions for learning,"Recent work has exploited boundedness of data in the unsupervised learning of new types of generative model. For nonnegative data it was recently shown that the maximum-entropy generative model is a Non negative Boltzmann Distribution not a Gaussian distribution, when the model is constrained to match the first and second order statistics of the data. Learning for practical sized problems is made difficult by the need to compute expectations under the model distribution. The computa tional cost of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and low fidelity of naive mean field techniques has led to increasing interest in advanced mean field theories and variational methods. Here I present a second order mean-field approximation for the Nonnegative Boltzmann Machine model, obtained using a ""high-temperature"" expansion. The theory is tested on learning a bimodal 2-dimensional model, a high-dimensional translationally invariant distribution, and a generative model for hand written digits. 1 Introduc",Optimization & Theoretical ML,139f0874f2ded2e41b0393c4ac5644f7-Paper.pdf,2000
A Support Vector Method for Clustering,"We present a novel method for clustering using the support vector ma chine approach. Data points are mapped to a high dimensional feature space, where support vectors are used to define a sphere enclosing them. The boundary of the sphere forms in data space a set of closed contours containing the data. Data points enclosed by each contour are defined as a cluster. As the width parameter of the Gaussian kernel is decreased, these contours fit the data more tightly and splitting of contours occurs. The algorithm works by separating clusters according to valleys in the un derlying probability distribution, and thus clusters can take on arbitrary geometrical shapes. As in other SV algorithms, outliers can be dealt with by introducing a soft margin constant leading to smoother cluster bound aries. The structure of the data is explored by varying the two parame ters. We investigate the dependence of our method on these parameters and apply it to several data sets. 1 Introduction Clustering i",Optimization & Theoretical ML,14cfdb59b5bda1fc245aadae15b1984a-Paper.pdf,2000
Incremental and Decremental Support Vector,"An on-line recursive algorithm for training support vector machines, one vector at a time, is presented. Adiabatic increments retain the Kuhn Tucker conditions on all previously seen training data, in a number of steps each computed analytically. The incremental procedure is re versible, and decremental ""unlearning"" offers an efficient method to ex actly evaluate leave-one-out generalization performance. Interpretation of decremental unlearning in feature space sheds light on the relationship between generalization and geometry of the data. 1 Introduction Training a support vector machine (SVM) requires solving a quadratic programming (QP) problem in a number of coefficients equal to the number of training examples. For very large datasets, standard numeric techniques for QP become infeasible. Practical techniques decompose the problem into manageable subproblems over part of the data [7, 5] or, in the limit, perform iterative pairwise [8] or component-wise [3] optimization.

Active inference in concept learning,"People are active experimenters, not just passive observers, constantly seeking new information relevant to their goals. A reasonable approach to active information gathering is to ask questions and conduct experiments that maximize the expected information gain, given current beliefs (Fedorov 1972, MacKay 1992, Oaksford & Chater 1994). In this paper we present results on an exploratory experiment designed to study people's active information gathering behavior on a concept learning task (Tenenbaum 2000). The results of the experiment are analyzed in terms of the expected information gain of the questions asked by subjects. In scientific inquiry and in everyday life, people seek out information relevant to perceptual and cognitive tasks. Scientists perform experiments to uncover causal relationships; people saccade to informative areas of visual scenes, turn their head towards surprising sounds, and ask questions to understand the meaning of concepts.

The Interplay of Symbolic and Subsymbolic,"Although connectionist models have provided insights into the nature of perception and motor control, connectionist accounts of higher cognition seldom go beyond an implementation of traditional symbol-processing theories. We describe a connectionist constraint satisfaction model of how people solve anagram problems. The model exploits statistics of English orthography, but also addresses the interplay of sub symbolic and symbolic computation by a mechanism that extracts approximate symbolic representations (partial orderings of letters) from sub symbolic structures and injects the extracted representation back into the model to assist in the solution of the anagram. We show the computational benefit of this extraction-injection process and discuss its relationship to conscious mental processes and working memory. We also account for experimental data concerning the difficulty of anagram solution based on the orthographic structure of the anagram string and the target word.

Sex with Support Vector Machines,"Nonlinear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are investigated for visual sex classification with low resolution ""thumbnail"" faces (21- by-12 pixels) processed from 1,755 images from the FER ET face database. The performance of SVMs is shown to be superior to traditional pattern classifiers (Linear, Quadratic, Fisher Linear Dis criminant, Nearest-Neighbor) as well as more modern techniques such as Radial Basis Function (RBF) classifiers and large ensemble RBF networks. Furthermore, the SVM performance (3.4% error) is currently the best result reported in the open literature. 1 Introduction In recent years, SVMs have been successfully applied to various tasks in com putational face-processing. These include face detection [14], face pose discrim ination [12] and face recognition [16]. Although facial sex classification has attracted much attention in the psychological literature [1, 4, 8, 15], relatively few computatinal learning methods have been proposed.

Recognizing Hand-written Digits Using,"The product of experts learning procedure [1] can discover a set of stochastic binary features that constitute a non-linear generative model of handwritten images of digits. The quality of generative models learned in this way can be assessed by learning a separate model for each class of digit and then comparing the unnormalized probabilities of test images under the 10 different class-specific models. To improve discriminative performance, it is helpful to learn a hierarchy of separate models for each digit class. Each model in the hierarchy has one layer of hidden units and the nth level model is trained on data that consists of the activities of the hidden units in the already trained (n - l)th level model. After train ing, each level produces a separate, unnormalized log probabilty score. With a three-level hierarchy for each of the 10 digit classes, a test image produces 30 scores which can be used as inputs to a supervised, logis tic classification network that is trained on sep",Computer Vision,1f1baa5b8edac74eb4eaa329f14a0361-Paper.pdf,2000
APRICODD: Approximate Policy Construction,"We propose a method of approximate dynamic programming for Markov decision processes (MDPs) using algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs). We produce near-optimal value functions and policies with much lower time and space requirements than exact dynamic programming. Our method reduces the sizes of the intermediate value functions generated during value iteration by replacing the values at the terminals of the ADD with ranges of values. Our method is demonstrated on a class of large MDPs (with up to 34 billion states), and we compare the results with the optimal value functions. 1 Introduction The last decade has seen much interest in structured approaches to solving planning prob lems under uncertainty formulated as Markov decision processes (MDPs). Structured algo rithms allow problems to be solved without explicit state-space enumeration by aggregating states of identical value. Structured approaches using decision trees have been applied to classical dynamic programming (DP) algorithms ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,201d7288b4c18a679e48b31c72c30ded-Paper.pdf,2000
Four-Iegged Walking Gait Control Using a,"To control the walking gaits of a four-legged robot we present a novel neuromorphic VLSI chip that coordinates the relative phasing of the robot's legs similar to how spinal Central Pattern Generators are believed to control vertebrate locomotion [3]. The chip controls the leg move ments by driving motors with time varying voltages which are the out puts of a small network of coupled oscillators. The characteristics of the chip's output voltages depend on a set of input parameters. The rela tionship between input parameters and output voltages can be computed analytically for an idealized system. In practice, however, this ideal re lationship is only approximately true due to transistor mismatch and off sets. Fine tuning of the chip's input parameters is done automatically by the robotic system, using an unsupervised Support Vector (SV) learning algorithm introduced recently [7]. The learning requires only that the description of the desired output is given. The machine learns from (un",Computer Vision,2647c1dba23bc0e0f9cdf75339e120d2-Paper.pdf,2000
A Mathematical Programming Approach to the,"We investigate a new kernel-based classifier: the Kernel Fisher Discrim inant (KFD). A mathematical programming formulation based on the ob servation that KFD maximizes the average margin permits an interesting modification of the original KFD algorithm yielding the sparse KFD. We find that both, KFD and the proposed sparse KFD, can be understood in an unifying probabilistic context. Furthermore, we show connections to Support Vector Machines and Relevance Vector Machines. From this understanding, we are able to outline an interesting kernel-regression technique based upon the KFD algorithm. Simulations support the use fulness of our approach. 1 Introduction Recent years have shown an enormous interest in kernel-based classification algorithms, primarily in Support Vector Machines (SVM) [2]. The success of SVMs seems to be trig gered by (i) their good generalization performance, (ii) the existence of a unique solution, and (iii) the strong theoretical background: structural risk minimi",Optimization & Theoretical ML,29530de21430b7540ec3f65135f7323c-Paper.pdf,2000
Using Free Energies to Represent Q-values in a,"The problem of reinforcement learning in large factored Markov decision processes is explored. The Q-value of a state-action pair is approximated by the free energy of a product of experts network. Network parameters are learned on-line using a modified SARSA algorithm which minimizes the inconsistency of the Q-values of consecutive state-action pairs. Ac tions are chosen based on the current value estimates by fixing the current state and sampling actions from the network using Gibbs sampling. The algorithm is tested on a co-operative multi-agent task. The product of experts model is found to perform comparably to table-based Q-Iearning for small instances of the task, and continues to perform well when the problem becomes too large for a table-based representation. 1 Introduction Online Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms try to find a policy which maximizes the expected time-discounted reward provided by the environment. They do this by performing sample backups to learn a value ",Reinforcement Learning,2d1b2a5ff364606ff041650887723470-Paper.pdf,2000
Dopamine Bonuses,"Substantial data support a temporal difference (TO) model of dopamine (OA) neuron activity in which the cells provide a global error signal for reinforcement learning. However, in certain cir cumstances, OA activity seems anomalous under the TO model, responding to non-rewarding stimuli. We address these anoma lies by suggesting that OA cells multiplex information about re ward bonuses, including Sutton's exploration bonuses and Ng et al's non-distorting shaping bonuses. We interpret this additional role for OA in terms of the unconditional attentional and psy chomotor effects of dopamine, having the computational role of guiding exploration. 1 Introduction Much evidence suggests that dopamine cells in the primate midbrain play an im portant role in reward and action learning. Electrophysiological studies support a theory that OA cells signal a global prediction error for summed future reward in appetitive conditioning tasks (Montague et al, 1996; Schultz et al, 1997), in the form of a",Reinforcement Learning,2f25f6e326adb93c5787175dda209ab6-Paper.pdf,2000
Sparse Greedy,"We present a simple sparse greedy technique to approximate the maximum a posteriori estimate of Gaussian Processes with much improved scaling behaviour in the sample size m. In particular, computational requirements are O(n2m), storage is O(nm), the cost for prediction is 0 (n ) and the cost to compute confidence bounds is O(nm), where n Â«: m. We show how to compute a stopping criterion, give bounds on the approximation error, and show applications to large scale problems. 1 Introduction Gaussian processes have become popular because they allow exact Bayesian analysis with simple matrix manipulations, yet provide good performance. They share with Support Vector machines and Regularization Networks the concept of regularization via Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces [3], that is, they allow the direct specification of the smoothness properties of the class of functions under consideration. However, Gaussian processes are not always the method of choice for large datasets, since they invo",Optimization & Theoretical ML,3214a6d842cc69597f9edf26df552e43-Paper.pdf,2000
Large Scale Bayes Point Machines,"The concept of averaging over classifiers is fundamental to the Bayesian analysis of learning. Based on this viewpoint, it has re cently been demonstrated for linear classifiers that the centre of mass of version space (the set of all classifiers consistent with the training set) - also known as the Bayes point - exhibits excel lent generalisation abilities. However, the billiard algorithm as pre sented in [4] is restricted to small sample size because it requires o (m2) of memory and 0 (N . m2) computational steps where m is the number of training patterns and N is the number of random draws from the posterior distribution. In this paper we present a method based on the simple perceptron learning algorithm which allows to overcome this algorithmic drawback. The method is al gorithmically simple and is easily extended to the multi-class case. We present experimental results on the MNIST data set of hand written digits which show that Bayes point machines (BPMs) are competitive with the",Optimization & Theoretical ML,333222170ab9edca4785c39f55221fe7-Paper.pdf,2000
Efficient Learning of Linear Perceptrons,"We consider the existence of efficient algorithms for learning the class of half-spaces in ~n in the agnostic learning model (Le., mak ing no prior assumptions on the example-generating distribution). The resulting combinatorial problem - finding the best agreement half-space over an input sample - is NP hard to approximate to within some constant factor. We suggest a way to circumvent this theoretical bound by introducing a new measure of success for such algorithms. An algorithm is IL-margin successful if the agreement ratio of the half-space it outputs is as good as that of any half-space once training points that are inside the IL-margins of its separating hyper-plane are disregarded. We prove crisp computational com plexity results with respect to this success measure: On one hand, for every positive IL, there exist efficient (poly-time) IL-margin suc cessful learning algorithms. On the other hand, we prove that unless P=NP, there is no algorithm that runs in time polynomial in th",Optimization & Theoretical ML,39027dfad5138c9ca0c474d71db915c3-Paper.pdf,2000
Gaussianization,"High dimensional data modeling is difficult mainly because the so-called ""curse of dimensionality"". We propose a technique called ""Gaussianiza tion"" for high dimensional density estimation, which alleviates the curse of dimensionality by exploiting the independence structures in the data. Gaussianization is motivated from recent developments in the statistics literature: projection pursuit, independent component analysis and Gaus sian mixture models with semi-tied covariances. We propose an iter ative Gaussianization procedure which converges weakly: at each it eration, the data is first transformed to the least dependent coordinates and then each coordinate is marginally Gaussianized by univariate tech niques. Gaussianization offers density estimation sharper than traditional kernel methods and radial basis function methods. Gaussianization can be viewed as efficient solution of nonlinear independent component anal ysis and high dimensional projection pursuit. 1 Introduction Density E",Optimization & Theoretical ML,3c947bc2f7ff007b86a9428b74654de5-Paper.pdf,2000
Error-correcting Codes on a Bethe-like Lattice,"We analyze Gallager codes by employing a simple mean-field approxi mation that distorts the model geometry and preserves important interac tions between sites. The method naturally recovers the probability prop agation decoding algorithm as an extremization of a proper free-energy. We find a thermodynamic phase transition that coincides with informa tion theoretical upper-bounds and explain the practical code performance in terms of the free-energy landscape. 1 Introduction In the last years increasing interest has been devoted to the application of mean-field tech niques to inference problems. There are many different ways of building mean-field theo ries. One can make a perturbative expansion around a tractable model [1,2], or assume a tractable structure and variationally determine the model parameters [3].

Homeostasis in a Silicon Integrate and Fire,"In this work, we explore homeostasis in a silicon integrate-and-fire neu ron. The neuron adapts its firing rate over long time periods on the order of seconds or minutes so that it returns to its spontaneous firing rate after a lasting perturbation. Homeostasis is implemented via two schemes. One scheme looks at the presynaptic activity and adapts the synaptic weight depending on the presynaptic spiking rate. The second scheme adapts the synaptic ""threshold"" depending on the neuron's activity. The threshold is lowered if the neuron's activity decreases over a long time and is increased for prolonged increase in postsynaptic activity. Both these mechanisms for adaptation use floating-gate technology. The re sults shown here are measured from a chip fabricated in a 2-J.lm CMOS process. 1 Introduction We explored long-time constant adaptation mechanisms in a simple integrate-and-fire sili con neuron.

Incorporating Second-Order Functional,"Incorporating prior knowledge of a particular task into the architecture of a learning algorithm can greatly improve generalization performance. We study here a case where we know that the function to be learned is non-decreasing in two of its arguments and convex in one of them. For this purpose we propose a class of functions similar to multi-layer neural networks but (1) that has those properties, (2) is a universal approximator of continuous functions with these and other properties. We apply this new class of functions to the task of modeling the price of call options. Experiments show improvements on regressing the price of call options using the new types of function classes that incorporate the a priori con straints. 1 Introduction Incorporating a priori knowledge of a particular task into a learning algorithm helps re ducing the necessary complexity of the learner and generally improves performance, if the incorporated knowledge is relevant to the task and really corresponds t",Optimization & Theoretical ML,44968aece94f667e4095002d140b5896-Paper.pdf,2000
Spike-Timing-Dependent Learning for,"We apply to oscillatory networks a class of learning rules in which synaptic weights change proportional to pre- and post-synaptic ac tivity, with a kernel A(r) measuring the effect for a postsynaptic spike a time r after the presynaptic one. The resulting synaptic ma trices have an outer-product form in which the oscillating patterns are represented as complex vectors. In a simple model, the even part of A(r) enhances the resonant response to learned stimulus by reducing the effective damping, while the odd part determines the frequency of oscillation. We relate our model to the olfactory cortex and hippocampus and their presumed roles in forming associative memories and input representations. 1 Introduction Recent studies of synapses between pyramidal neocortical and hippocampal neu rons [1, 2, 3, 4] have revealed that changes in synaptic efficacy can depend on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes.

On Reversing Jensen's Inequality,"Jensen's inequality is a powerful mathematical tool and one of the workhorses in statistical learning. Its applications therein include the EM algorithm, Bayesian estimation and Bayesian inference. Jensen com putes simple lower bounds on otherwise intractable quantities such as products of sums and latent log-likelihoods. This simplification then per mits operations like integration and maximization. Quite often (i.e. in discriminative learning) upper bounds are needed as well. We derive and prove an efficient analytic inequality that provides such variational upper bounds. This inequality holds for latent variable mixtures of exponential family distributions and thus spans a wide range of contemporary statis tical models. We also discuss applications of the upper bounds including maximum conditional likelihood, large margin discriminative models and conditional Bayesian inference.

From Mixtures of Mixtures to,"We establish a principled framework for adaptive transform cod ing. Transform coders are often constructed by concatenating an ad hoc choice of transform with suboptimal bit allocation and quan tizer design. Instead, we start from a probabilistic latent variable model in the form of a mixture of constrained Gaussian mixtures. From this model we derive a transform coding algorithm, which is a constrained version of the generalized Lloyd algorithm for vector quantizer design. A byproduct of our derivation is the introduc tion of a new transform basis, which unlike other transforms (PCA, DCT, etc.) is explicitly optimized for coding. Image compression experiments show adaptive transform coders designed with our al gorithm improve compressed image signal-to-noise ratio up to 3 dB compared to global transform coding and 0.5 to 2 dB compared to other adaptive transform coders. 1 Introduction Compression algorithms for image and video signals often use transform coding as a low-complexity alt",Computer Vision,4888241374e8c62ddd9b4c3cfd091f96-Paper.pdf,2000
Algorithmic Stability and Generalization,"We present a novel way of obtaining PAC-style bounds on the gen eralization error of learning algorithms, explicitly using their stabil ity properties. A stable learner is one for which the learned solution does not change much with small changes in the training set. The bounds we obtain do not depend on any measure of the complexity of the hypothesis space (e.g. VC dimension) but rather depend on how the learning algorithm searches this space, and can thus be applied even when the VC dimension is infinite. We demonstrate that regularization networks possess the required stability property and apply our method to obtain new bounds on their generalization performance. 1 Introduction A key issue in computational learning theory is to bound the generalization error of learning algorithms. Until recently, most of the research in that area has focused on uniform a-priori bounds giving a guarantee that the difference between the training error and the test error is uniformly small for any hy",Optimization & Theoretical ML,49ad23d1ec9fa4bd8d77d02681df5cfa-Paper.pdf,2000
The Kernel Trick for Distances,"A method is described which, like the kernel trick in support vector ma chines (SVMs), lets us generalize distance-based algorithms to operate in feature spaces, usually nonlinearly related to the input space. This is done by identifying a class of kernels which can be represented as norm-based distances in Hilbert spaces. It turns out that common kernel algorithms, such as SVMs and kernel PCA, are actually really distance based algorithms and can be run with that class of kernels, too. As well as providing a useful new insight into how these algorithms work, the present work can form the basis for conceiving new algorithms. 1 Introduction One of the crucial ingredients of SVMs is the so-called kernel trick for the computation of dot products in high-dimensional feature spaces using simple functions defined on pairs of input patterns. This trick allows the formulation of nonlinear variants of any algorithm that can be cast in terms of dot products, SVMs being but the most prominent exa",Optimization & Theoretical ML,4e87337f366f72daa424dae11df0538c-Paper.pdf,2000
Higher-order Statistical Properties,"We present evidence that several higher-order statistical proper ties of natural images and signals can be explained by a stochastic model which simply varies scale of an otherwise stationary Gaus sian process. We discuss two interesting consequences. The first is that a variety of natural signals can be related through a com mon model of spherically invariant random processes, which have the attractive property that the joint densities can be constructed from the one dimensional marginal. The second is that in some cas es the non-stationarity assumption and only second order methods can be explicitly exploited to find a linear basis that is equivalent to independent components obtained with higher-order methods. This is demonstrated on spectro-temporal components of speech. 1 Introduction Recently, considerable attention has been paid to understanding and modeling the non-Gaussian or ""higher-order"" properties of natural signals, particularly images.

Probabilistic Semantic Video Indexing,"We propose a novel probabilistic framework for semantic video in dexing. We define probabilistic multimedia objects (multijects) to map low-level media features to high-level semantic labels. A graphical network of such multijects (multinet) captures scene con text by discovering intra-frame as well as inter-frame dependency relations between the concepts. The main contribution is a novel application of a factor graph framework to model this network. We model relations between semantic concepts in terms of their co-occurrence as well as the temporal dependencies between these concepts within video shots. Using the sum-product algorithm [1] for approximate or exact inference in these factor graph multinets, we attempt to correct errors made during isolated concept detec tion by forcing high-level constraints. This results in a significant improvement in the overall detection performance. 1 Introduction Research in video retrieval has traditionally focussed on the paradigm of query-by ex",Computer Vision,52d2752b150f9c35ccb6869cbf074e48-Paper.pdf,2000
Accumulator networks: Suitors of local,"One way to approximate inference in richly-connected graphical models is to apply the sum-product algorithm (a.k.a. probabil ity propagation algorithm), while ignoring the fact that the graph has cycles. The sum-product algorithm can be directly applied in Gaussian networks and in graphs for coding, but for many condi tional probability functions - including the sigmoid function - di rect application of the sum-product algorithm is not possible. We introduce ""accumulator networks"" that have low local complexity (but exponential global complexity) so the sum-product algorithm can be directly applied. In an accumulator network, the probability of a child given its parents is computed by accumulating the inputs from the parents in a Markov chain or more generally a tree. After giving expressions for inference and learning in accumulator net works, we give results on the ""bars problem"" and on the problem of extracting translated, overlapping faces from an image. 1 Introduction Graphical pr",Computer Vision,537de305e941fccdbba5627e3eefbb24-Paper.pdf,2000

The method is based on a combination of a Bayesian online al gorithm together with a sequential construction of a relevant subsample of the data which fully specifies the prediction of the model. Experi mental results on toy examples and large real-world data sets indicate the efficiency of the approach. 1 Introduction Gaussian processes (GP) [1; 15] provide promising non-parametric tools for modelling real-world statistical problems. Like other kernel based methods, e.g. Support Vector Ma chines (SVMs) [13], they combine a high flexibility ofthe model by working in high (often 00) dimensional feature spaces with the simplicity that all operations are ""kernelized"" i.e. they are performed in the (lower dimensional) input space using positive definite kernels.

We present a consolidation model in which hierarchical connections in the cortex, that initially instantiate purely semantic information acquired through probabilistic unsupervised learning, come to instantiate episodic infor mation as well. The hippocampus is responsible for helping complete partial input patterns before consolidation is complete, while also train ing the cortex to perform appropriate completion by itself. 1 Introduction The hippocampal formation and adjacent cortical areas have long been believed to be in volved in the acquisition and retrieval of long-term memory for events and other declarative information.

Automated State Abstraction for Options using,"Learning a complex task can be significantly facilitated by defining a hierarchy of subtasks. An agent can learn to choose between various temporally abstract actions, each solving an assigned subtask, to accom plish the overall task. In this paper, we study hierarchical learning using the framework of options. We argue that to take full advantage of hier archical structure, one should perform option-specific state abstraction, and that if this is to scale to larger tasks, state abstraction should be au tomated. We adapt McCallum's U-Tree algorithm to automatically build option-specific representations of the state feature space, and we illus trate the resulting algorithm using a simple hierarchical task. Results suggest that automated option-specific state abstraction is an attractive approach to making hierarchical learning systems more effective. 1 Introduction Researchers in the field of reinforcement learning have recently focused considerable at tention on temporally abstract act",Reinforcement Learning,596dedf4498e258e4bdc9fd70df9a859-Paper.pdf,2000
Structure learning in human causal induction,"We use graphical models to explore the question of how people learn sim ple causal relationships from data. The two leading psychological theo ries can both be seen as estimating the parameters of a fixed graph. We argue that a complete account of causal induction should also consider how people learn the underlying causal graph structure, and we propose to model this inductive process as a Bayesian inference. Our argument is supported through the discussion of three data sets. 1 Introduction Causality plays a central role in human mental life. Our behavior depends upon our under standing of the causal structure of our environment, and we are remarkably good at infer ring causation from mere observation.

The new formulations is shown to extend standard thresholding methods in an adaptive and intuitive way, leading to improved segmentation accuracy. 1 Introduction Given the recent advances on video coding and streaming technology and the pervasiveness of video as a form of communication, there is currently a strong interest in the development of techniques for browsing, categorizing, retrieving and automatically summarizing video.

While both approaches yield similar performance in practice, they out perform standard LDA features and show a 10% relative improvement in the word error rate over state-of-the-art cepstral features on a large vocabulary telephony speech recognition task. 1 Introduction Modern speech recognition systems use cepstral features characterizing the short-term spectrum of the speech signal for classifying frames into phonetic classes.

Kernel expansions with unlabeled examples,"Modern classification applications necessitate supplementing the few available labeled examples with unlabeled examples to improve classi fication performance. We present a new tractable algorithm for exploit ing unlabeled examples in discriminative classification. This is achieved essentially by expanding the input vectors into longer feature vectors via both labeled and unlabeled examples. The resulting classification method can be interpreted as a discriminative kernel density estimate and is read ily trained via the EM algorithm, which in this case is both discriminative and achieves the optimal solution. We provide, in addition, a purely dis criminative formulation of the estimation problem by appealing to the maximum entropy framework. We demonstrate that the proposed ap proach requires very few labeled examples for high classification accu racy. 1 Introduction In many modern classification problems such as text categorization, very few labeled ex amples are available but a large",Optimization & Theoretical ML,5bce843dd76db8c939d5323dd3e54ec9-Paper.pdf,2000
Universality and individuality in a neural,"The problem of neural coding is to understand how sequences of action potentials (spikes) are related to sensory stimuli, motor out puts, or (ultimately) thoughts and intentions. One clear question is whether the same coding rules are used by different neurons, or by corresponding neurons in different individuals. We present a quantitative formulation of this problem using ideas from informa tion theory, and apply this approach to the analysis of experiments in the fly visual system. We find significant individual differences in the structure of the code, particularly in the way that tempo ral patterns of spikes are used to convey information beyond that available from variations in spike rate. On the other hand, all the flies in our ensemble exhibit a high coding efficiency, so that every spike carries the same amount of information in all the individuals. Thus the neural code has a quantifiable mixture of individuality and universality. 1 Introduction When two people look at the same",Computer Vision,5fa9e41bfec0725742cc9d15ef594120-Paper.pdf,2000
Generalized Belief Propagation,"Belief propagation (BP) was only supposed to work for tree-like networks but works surprisingly well in many applications involving networks with loops, including turbo codes. However, there has been little understanding of the algorithm or the nature of the solutions it finds for general graphs. We show that BP can only converge to a stationary point of an approximate free energy, known as the Bethe free energy in statis tical physics. This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. More importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more ac curate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our analysis, we de rive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions ofthese Kikuchi approximations.

Multiple timesc ales of adaptation in a neural,"Many neural systems extend their dynamic range by adaptation. We ex amine the timescales of adaptation in the context of dynamically mod ulated rapidly-varying stimuli, and demonstrate in the fly visual system that adaptation to the statistical ensemble of the stimulus dynamically maximizes information transmission about the time-dependent stimulus. Further, while the rate response has long transients, the adaptation takes place on timescales consistent with optimal variance estimation. 1 Introduction Adaptation was one of the first phenomena discovered when Adrian recorded the responses of single sensory neurons [1, 2]. Since that time, many different forms of adaptation have been found in almost all sensory systems. The simplest forms of adaptation, such as light and dark adaptation in the visual system, seem to involve just discarding a large constant background signal so that the system can maintain sensitivity to small changes.

The framework transforms the denois ing and dereverberation problems into Bayes-optimal signal estimation. The key idea is to use a strong speech model that is pre-trained on a large data set of clean speech. Computational efficiency is achieved by using variational EM, working in the frequency domain, and employing conjugate priors. The framework covers both single and multiple micro phones. We apply this approach to noisy reverberant speech signals and get results substantially better than standard methods. 1 Introduction This paper presents a statistical-model-based algorithm for reconstructing a speech source from microphone signals recorded in a stationary noisy reverberant environment.

"Modelling spatial recall, mental imagery and","We present a computational model of the neural mechanisms in the pari etal and temporal lobes that support spatial navigation, recall of scenes and imagery of the products of recall. Long term representations are stored in the hippocampus, and are associated with local spatial and object-related features in the parahippocampal region. Viewer-centered representations are dynamically generated from long term memory in the parietal part of the model. The model thereby simulates recall and im agery of locations and objects in complex environments. After parietal damage, the model exhibits hemispatial neglect in mental imagery that rotates with the imagined perspective of the observer, as in the famous Milan Square experiment [1].

Adaptive Object Representation with,"Theories of object recognition often assume that only one representa tion scheme is used within one visual-processing pathway. Versatility of the visual system comes from having multiple visual-processing pathways, each specialized in a different category of objects. We propose a theoretically simpler alternative, capable of explaining the same set of data and more. A single primary visual-processing pathway, loosely modular, is assumed. Memory modules are attached to sites along this pathway. Object-identity decision is made independently at each site. A site's response time is a monotonic-decreasing function of its confidence regarding its decision. An observer's response is the first-arriving response from any site. The effective representation(s) of such a system, determined empirically, can appear to be specialized for different tasks and stimuli, consistent with recent clinical and functional-imaging findings.

Text Classification using String Kernels,"We introduce a novel kernel for comparing two text documents. The kernel is an inner product in the feature space consisting of all subsequences of length k. A subsequence is any ordered se quence of k characters occurring in the text though not necessarily contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an exponentially decaying factor of their full length in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences which are close to contiguous. A direct compu tation of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k. The paper describes how despite this fact the inner product can be efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming technique. A preliminary experimental comparison of the performance of the kernel compared with a stan dard word feature space kernel [6] is made showing encouraging results. 1 Introduction Standard learning systems (like neural networks or decision tree",NLP,68c694de94e6c110f42e587e8e48d852-Paper.pdf,2000
Fast Training of Support Vector Classifiers,"In this communication we present a new algorithm for solving Support Vector Classifiers (SVC) with large training data sets. The new algorithm is based on an Iterative Re-Weighted Least Squares procedure which is used to optimize the SVc. Moreover, a novel sample selection strategy for the working set is presented, which randomly chooses the working set among the training samples that do not fulfill the stopping criteria. The validity of both proposals, the optimization procedure and sample selection strategy, is shown by means of computer experiments using well-known data sets. 1 INTRODUCTION The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a powerful tool to solve pattern recognition prob lems [13, 14] in such a way that the solution is completely described as a linear combination of several training samples, named the Support Vectors.

The theory of Gaussian and empirical processes allow us to prove the margin type inequalities for the most general functional classes, the complexity of the class being measured via the so called Gaussian complexity func tions. As a simple application of our results, we obtain the bounds of Schapire, Freund, Bartlett and Lee for the generalization error of boost ing. We also substantially improve the results of Bartlett on bounding the generalization error of neural networks in terms of h -norms of the weights of neurons.

A Neural Probabilistic Language Model,"A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: we propose to fight it with its own weapons. In the proposed approach one learns simultaneously (1) a distributed rep resentation for each word (i.e. a similarity between words) along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed with these repre sentations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar to words forming an already seen sentence. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach very significantly im proves on a state-of-the-art trigram model. 1 Introduction A fundamental problem that makes language modeling and other learning problems diffi cult is the curse of dimensionality.

Beyond maximum likelihood and density,"The goal of many unsupervised learning procedures is to bring two probability distributions into alignment. Generative models such as Gaussian mixtures and Boltzmann machines can be cast in this light, as can recoding models such as ICA and projection pursuit. We propose a novel sample-based error measure for these classes of models, which applies even in situations where maximum likelihood (ML) and probability density estimation-based formulations can not be applied, e.g., models that are nonlinear or have intractable posteriors. Furthermore, our sample-based error measure avoids the difficulties of approximating a density function. We prove that with an unconstrained model, (1) our approach converges on the correct solution as the number of samples goes to infinity, and (2) the expected solution of our approach in the generative framework is the ML solution. Finally, we evaluate our approach via simula tions of linear and nonlinear models on mixture of Gaussians and ICA problems.

We focus on six examples, including nearest-neighbor classification, kernel density estimation, outlier detection, and the two-point correlation. These include any problem which abstractly requires a comparison of each of the N points in a dataset with each other point and would naively be solved using N2 distance computations. In practice N is often large enough to make this infeasible. We present a suite of new geometric techniques which are applicable in principle to any 'N-body' computation including large-scale mixtures of Gaussians, RBF neural networks, and HMM's.

By interpreting PCA as density estimation, we show how to use Bayesian model selection to es timate the true dimensionality of the data. The resulting estimate is sim ple to compute yet guaranteed to pick the correct dimensionality, given enough data. The estimate involves an integral over the Steifel manifold of k-frames, which is difficult to compute exactly. But after choosing an appropriate parameterization and applying Laplace's method, an accu rate and practical estimator is obtained. In simulations, it is convincingly better than cross-validation and other proposed algorithms, plus it runs much faster. 1 Introduction Recovering the intrinsic dimensionality of a data set is a classic and fundamental problem in data analysis.

An Adaptive Metric Machine for Pattern,"Nearest neighbor classification assumes locally constant class con ditional probabilities. This assumption becomes invalid in high dimensions with finite samples due to the curse of dimensionality. Severe bias can be introduced under these conditions when using the nearest neighbor rule. We propose a locally adaptive nearest neighbor classification method to try to minimize bias. We use a Chi-squared distance analysis to compute a flexible metric for pro ducing neighborhoods that are elongated along less relevant feature dimensions and constricted along most influential ones. As a result, the class conditional probabilities tend to be smoother in the mod ified neighborhoods, whereby better classification performance can be achieved.

Stability and noise in biochemical switches,"Many processes in biology, from the regulation of gene expression in bacteria to memory in the brain, involve switches constructed from networks of biochemical reactions. Crucial molecules are present in small numbers, raising questions about noise and stability. Analysis of noise in simple reaction schemes indicates that switches stable for years and switchable in milliseconds can be built from fewer than one hundred molecules. Prospects for direct tests of this prediction, as well as implications, are discussed. 1 Introduction The problem of building a reliable switch arises in several different biological con texts. The classical example is the switching on and off of gene expression during development [1], or in simpler systems such as phage .A [2].

Applying the results to learning a teacher defined by a two-layer network, I can directly compare GP and Bayesian NN learning. I find that a GP in general requires CJ (d S )-training examples to learn input features of order s (d is the input dimension), whereas a NN can learn the task with order the number of adjustable weights training examples. Since a GP can be considered as an infinite NN, the results show that even in the Bayesian approach, it is important to limit the complexity of the learning machine.

In this paper, we show how a hier archy of behaviors can be used to create and select among variable length short-term memories appropriate for a task. At higher lev els in the hierarchy, the agent abstracts over lower-level details and looks back over a variable number of high-level decisions in time.

In video sprites, instead of storing whole images, the object of inter est is separated from the background and the video samples are stored as a sequence of alpha-matted sprites with associated veloc ity information. They can be rendered anywhere on the screen to create a novel animation of the object. We present methods to cre ate such animations by finding a sequence of sprite samples that is both visually smooth and follows a desired path. To estimate visual smoothness, we train a linear classifier to estimate visual similarity between video samples. If the motion path is known in advance, we use beam search",Computer Vision,958adb57686c2fdec5796398de5f317a-Paper.pdf,2000
Discovering Hidden Variables:,"A serious problem in learning probabilistic models is the presence of hid den variables. These variables are not observed, yet interact with several of the observed variables. As such, they induce seemingly complex de pendencies among the latter. In recent years, much attention has been devoted to the development of algorithms for learning parameters, and in some cases structure, in the presence of hidden variables. In this pa per, we address the related problem of detecting hidden variables that interact with the observed variables. This problem is of interest both for improving our understanding of the domain and as a preliminary step that guides the learning procedure towards promising models. A very natural approach is to search for ""structural signatures"" of hidden variables - substructures in the learned network that tend to suggest the presence of a hidden variable. We make this basic idea concrete, and show how to integrate it with structure-search algorithms. We evaluate this ",Computer Vision,95e6834d0a3d99e9ea8811855ae9229d-Paper.pdf,2000
Natural sound statistics and divisive,"We explore the statistical properties of natural sound stimuli pre processed with a bank of linear filters. The responses of such filters exhibit a striking form of statistical dependency, in which the response variance of each filter grows with the response amplitude of filters tuned for nearby frequencies. These dependencies may be substantially re duced using an operation known as divisive normalization, in which the response of each filter is divided by a weighted sum of the recti fied responses of other filters. The weights may be chosen to maximize the independence of the normalized responses for an ensemble of natu ral sounds. We demonstrate that the resulting model accounts for non linearities in the response characteristics of the auditory nerve, by com paring model simulations to electrophysiological recordings. In previous work (NIPS, 1998) we demonstrated that an analogous model derived from the statistics of natural images accounts for non-linear properties of neurons in p",NLP,96c5c28becf18e71190460a9955aa4d8-Paper.pdf,2000
Regularized Winnow Methods,"In theory, the Winnow multiplicative update has certain advantages over the Perceptron additive update when there are many irrelevant attributes. Recently, there has been much effort on enhancing the Perceptron algo rithm by using regularization, leading to a class of linear classification methods called support vector machines. Similarly, it is also possible to apply the regularization idea to the Winnow algorithm, which gives meth ods we call regularized Winnows. We show that the resulting methods compare with the basic Winnows in a similar way that a support vector machine compares with the Perceptron. We investigate algorithmic is sues and learning properties of the derived methods. Some experimental results will also be provided to illustrate different methods. 1 Introduction In this paper, we consider the binary classification problem that is to determine a label y E {-1, 1} associated with an input vector x.

FaceSync: A linear operator for measuring,"FaceSync is an optimal linear algorithm that finds the degree of syn chronization between the audio and image recordings of a human speaker. Using canonical correlation, it finds the best direction to com bine all the audio and image data, projecting them onto a single axis. FaceSync uses Pearson's correlation to measure the degree of synchro nization between the audio and image data. We derive the optimal linear transform to combine the audio and visual information and describe an implementation that avoids the numerical problems caused by comput ing the correlation matrices. 1 Motivation In many applications, we want to know about the synchronization between an audio signal and the corresponding image data. In a teleconferencing system, we might want to know which of the several people imaged by a camera is heard by the microphones; then, we can direct the camera to the speaker. In post-production for a film, clean audio dialog is often dubbed over the video; we want to adjust the au",Computer Vision,9f6992966d4c363ea0162a056cb45fe5-Paper.pdf,2000
What can a single neuron compute?,"In this paper we formulate a description of the computation per formed by a neuron as a combination of dimensional reduction and nonlinearity. We implement this description for the Hodgkin Huxley model, identify the most relevant dimensions and find the nonlinearity. A two dimensional description already captures a significant fraction of the information that spikes carry about dy namic inputs. This description also shows that computation in the Hodgkin-Huxley model is more complex than a simple integrate and-fire or perceptron model. 1 Introduction Classical neural network models approximate neurons as devices that sum their inputs and generate a nonzero output if the sum exceeds a threshold. From our current state of knowledge in neurobiology it is easy to criticize these models as over simplified: where is the complex geometry of neurons, or the many different kinds of ion channel, each with its own intricate multistate kinetics?

Mixtures of Gaussian Processes,"We introduce the mixture of Gaussian processes (MGP) model which is useful for applications in which the optimal bandwidth of a map is input dependent. The MGP is derived from the mixture of experts model and can also be used for modeling general conditional probability densities. We discuss how Gaussian processes -in particular in form of Gaussian process classification, the support vector machine and the MGP model can be used for quantifying the dependencies in graphical models. 1 Introduction Gaussian processes are typically used for regression where it is assumed that the underly ing function is generated by one infinite-dimensional Gaussian distribution (i.e. we assume a Gaussian prior distribution). In Gaussian process regression (GPR) we further assume that output data are generated by additive Gaussian noise, i.e. we assume a Gaussian like lihood model.

Tree-Based Modeling and Estimation of,"We present the embedded trees algorithm, an iterative technique for estimation of Gaussian processes defined on arbitrary graphs. By exactly solving a series of modified problems on embedded span ning trees, it computes the conditional means with an efficiency comparable to or better than other techniques. Unlike other meth ods, the embedded trees algorithm also computes exact error co variances. The error covariance computation is most efficient for graphs in which removing a small number of edges reveals an em bedded tree. In this context, we demonstrate that sparse loopy graphs can provide a significant increase in modeling power rela tive to trees, with only a minor increase in estimation complexity. 1 Introduction Graphical models are an invaluable tool for defining and manipulating probability distributions. In modeling stochastic processes with graphical models, two basic problems arise: (i) specifying a class of graphs with which to model or approximate the process; and (ii) de",Optimization & Theoretical ML,a3545bd79d31f9a72d3a78690adf73fc-Paper.pdf,2000
Learning winner-take-all competition between,"It has long been known that lateral inhibition in neural networks can lead to a winner-take-all competition, so that only a single neuron is active at a steady state. Here we show how to organize lateral inhibition so that groups of neurons compete to be active. Given a collection of poten tially overlapping groups, the inhibitory connectivity is set by a formula that can be interpreted as arising from a simple learning rule. Our analy sis demonstrates that such inhibition generally results in winner-take-all competition between the given groups, with the exception of some de generate cases. In a broader context, the network serves as a particular illustration of the general distinction between permitted and forbidden sets, which was introduced recently. From this viewpoint, the computa tional function of our network is to store and retrieve memories as per mitted sets of coactive neurons.

Equipped with a camera, spectrometer and eddy current sensor, this robot searched the ice sheets of Antarctica and autonomously made the first robotic identification of a meteorite, in January 2000 at the Elephant Moraine. This paper discusses rock classification from a robotic platform, and describes the system onboard Nomad. 1 Introduction Figure 1 : Human meteorite search with snowmobiles on the Antarctic ice sheets, and on foot in the moraines. Antarctica contains the most fertile meteorite hunting grounds on Earth. The pristine, dry and cold environment ensures that meteorites deposited there are preserved for long periods.

Foundations for a Circuit Complexity Theory of,"We introduce total wire length as salient complexity measure for an anal ysis of the circuit complexity of sensory processing in biological neural systems and neuromorphic engineering. This new complexity measure is applied to a set of basic computational problems that apparently need to be solved by circuits for translation-and scale-invariant sensory process ing. We exhibit new circuit design strategies for these new benchmark functions that can be implemented within realistic complexity bounds, in particular with linear or almost linear total wire length. 1 Introduction Circuit complexity theory is a classical area of theoretical computer science, that provides estimates for the complexity of circuits for computing specific benchmark functions, such as binary addition, multiplication and sorting (see, e.g. (Savage, 1998Â».

The Use of MDL to Select among,"How should we decide among competing explanations of a cognitive process given limited observations? The problem of model selection is at the heart of progress in cognitive science. In this paper, Minimum Description Length (MDL) is introduced as a method for selecting among computational models of cognition. We also show that differential geometry provides an intuitive understanding of what drives model selection in MDL. Finally, adequacy of MDL is demonstrated in two areas of cognitive modeling. 1 Model Selection and Model Complexity The development and testing of computational models of cognitive processing are a central focus in cognitive science. A model embodies a solution to a problem whose adequacy is evaluated by its ability to mimic behavior by capturing the regularities underlying observed data. This enterprise of model selection is challenging because of the competing goals that must be satisfied.

Learning and Tracking Cyclic Human,"We present methods for learning and tracking human motion in video. We estimate a statistical model of typical activities from a large set of 3D periodic human motion data by segmenting these data automatically into ""cycles"". Then the mean and the princi pal components of the cycles are computed using a new algorithm that accounts for missing information and enforces smooth tran sitions between cycles. The learned temporal model provides a prior probability distribution over human motions that can be used in a Bayesian framework for tracking human subjects in complex monocular video sequences and recovering their 3D motion. 1 Introduction The modeling and tracking of human motion in video is important for problems as varied as animation, video database search, sports medicine, and human-computer interaction. Technically, the human body can be approximated by a collection of articulated limbs and its motion can be thought of as a collection of time-series describing the joint angles as ",Computer Vision,ad4cc1fb9b068faecfb70914acc63395-Paper.pdf,2000
Decomposition of Reinforcement Learning,"This paper presents predictive gain scheduling, a technique for simplify ing reinforcement learning problems by decomposition. Link admission control of self-similar call traffic is used to demonstrate the technique. The control problem is decomposed into on-line prediction of near-fu ture call arrival rates, and precomputation of policies for Poisson call ar rival processes. At decision time, the predictions are used to select among the policies. Simulations show that this technique results in sig nificantly faster learning without any performance loss, compared to a reinforcement learning controller that does not decompose the problem. 1 Introduction In multi-service communications networks, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks, resource control is of crucial importance for the network operator as well as for the users. The objective is to maintain the service quality while maximizing the operator's revenue.

Active Support Vector Machine,"An active set strategy is applied to the dual of a simple reformula tion of the standard quadratic program of a linear support vector machine. This application generates a fast new dual algorithm that consists of solving a finite number of linear equations, with a typically large dimensionality equal to the number of points to be classified. However, by making novel use of the Sherman-Morrison Woodbury formula, a much smaller matrix of the order of the orig inal input space is inverted at each step. Thus, a problem with a 32-dimensional input space and 7 million points required inverting positive definite symmetric matrices of size 33 x 33 with a total run ning time of 96 minutes on a 400 MHz Pentium II. The algorithm requires no specialized quadratic or linear programming code, but merely a linear equation solver which is publicly available. 1 Introduction Support vector machines (SVMs) [23, 5, 14, 12] are powerful tools for data classifi cation.

We then show how the approach implies new algorithm s for solving problems usually associated with generative models. New algorithms are described for dealing with pattern recognition problems with very different pattern distributions and dealing with unlabeled data.

Generalizable Singular Value,"We demonstrate that statistical analysis of ill-posed data sets is subject to a bias, which can be observed when projecting indepen dent test set examples onto a basis defined by the training exam ples. Because the training examples in an ill-posed data set do not fully span the signal space the observed training set variances in each basis vector will be too high compared to the average vari ance of the test set projections onto the same basis vectors. On basis of this understanding we introduce the Generalizable Singu lar Value Decomposition (GenSVD) as a means to reduce this bias by re-estimation of the singular values obtained in a conventional Singular Value Decomposition, allowing for a generalization perfor mance increase of a subsequent statistical model. We demonstrate that the algorithm succesfully corrects bias in a data set from a functional PET activation study of the human brain. 1 Ill-posed Data Sets An ill-posed data set has more dimensions in each example than there ar",Optimization & Theoretical ML,b4568df26077653eeadf29596708c94b-Paper.pdf,2000
Sparsity of data representation of optimal kernel,"Vapnik's result that the expectation of the generalisation error ofthe opti mal hyperplane is bounded by the expectation of the ratio of the number of support vectors to the number of training examples is extended to a broad class of kernel machines. The class includes Support Vector Ma chines for soft margin classification and regression, and Regularization Networks with a variety of kernels and cost functions. We show that key inequalities in Vapnik's result become equalities once ""the classification error"" is replaced by ""the margin error"", with the latter defined as an in stance with positive cost. In particular we show that expectations of the true margin error and the empirical margin error are equal, and that the sparse solutions for kernel machines are possible only if the cost function is ""partially"" insensitive. 1 Introduction Minimization of regularized risk is a backbone of several recent advances in machine learn ing, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) [13], Regulariz",Optimization & Theoretical ML,c164bbc9d6c72a52c599bbb43d8db8e1-Paper.pdf,2000
Sparse Kernel,"'Kernel' principal component analysis (PCA) is an elegant non linear generalisation of the popular linear data analysis method, where a kernel function implicitly defines a nonlinear transforma tion into a feature space wherein standard PCA is performed. Un fortunately, the technique is not 'sparse', since the components thus obtained are expressed in terms of kernels associated with ev ery training vector. This paper shows that by approximating the covariance matrix in feature space by a reduced number of exam ple vectors, using a maximum-likelihood approach, we may obtain a highly sparse form of kernel PCA without loss of effectiveness. 1 Introduction Principal component analysis (PCA) is a well-established technique for dimension ality reduction, and examples of its many applications include data compression, image processing, visualisation, exploratory data analysis, pattern recognition and time series prediction.

Rate-coded Restricted Boltzmann Machines for,"We describe a neurally-inspired, unsupervised learning algorithm that builds a non-linear generative model for pairs of face images from the same individual. Individuals are then recognized by finding the highest relative probability pair among all pairs that consist of a test image and an image whose identity is known. Our method compares favorably with other methods in the literature. The generative model consists of a single layer of rate-coded, non-linear feature detectors and it has the property that, given a data vector, the true posterior probability distribution over the feature detector activities can be inferred rapidly without iteration or approximation.

Shape Context: A new descriptor for,"We develop an approach to object recognition based on match ing shapes and using a resulting measure of similarity in a nearest neighbor classifier. The key algorithmic problem here is that of finding pointwise correspondences between an image shape and a stored prototype shape. We introduce a new shape descriptor, the shape context, which makes this possible, using a simple and robust algorithm. The shape context at a point captures the distri bution over relative positions of other shape points and thus sum marizes global shape in a rich, local descriptor. We demonstrate that shape contexts greatly simplify recovery of correspondences between points of two given shapes. Once shapes are aligned, shape contexts are used to define a robust score for measuring shape sim ilarity.

"Position Variance, Recurrence and Perceptual","Stimulus arrays are inevitably presented at different positions on the retina in visual tasks, even those that nominally require fixation. In par ticular, this applies to many perceptual learning tasks. We show that per ceptual inference or discrimination in the face of positional variance has a structurally different quality from inference about fixed position stimuli, involving a particular, quadratic, non-linearity rather than a purely lin ear discrimination. We show the advantage taking this non-linearity into account has for discrimination, and suggest it as a role for recurrent con nections in area VI, by demonstrating the superior discrimination perfor mance of a recurrent network. We propose that learning the feedforward and recurrent neural connections for these tasks corresponds to the fast and slow components of learning observed in perceptual learning tasks. 1 Introduction The field of perceptual learning in simple, but high precision, visual tasks (such as vernier acuity t",Computer Vision,c45008212f7bdf6eab6050c2a564435a-Paper.pdf,2000

We study symmet ric threshold-linear networks and derive stability results that go beyond the insights that can be gained from Lyapunov theory or energy functions. By applying linear analysis to subnetworks com posed of coactive neurons, we determine the stability of potential steady states. We find that stability depends on two types of eigen modes. One type determines global stability and the other type determines whether or not multistability is possible. We can prove the equivalence of our stability criteria with criteria taken from quadratic programming. Also, we show that there are permitted sets of neurons that can be coactive at a steady state and forbid den sets that cannot. Permitted sets are clustered in the sense that subsets of permitted sets are permitted and supersets of forbidden sets are forbidden.

Learning Switching Linear Models of Human,"The human figure exhibits complex and rich dynamic behavior that is both nonlinear and time-varying. Effective models of human dynamics can be learned from motion capture data using switching linear dynamic system (SLDS) models. We present results for human motion synthe sis, classification, and visual tracking using learned SLDS models. Since exact inference in SLDS is intractable, we present three approximate in ference algorithms and compare their performance. In particular, a new variational inference algorithm is obtained by casting the SLDS model as a Dynamic Bayesian Network. Classification experiments show the superiority of SLDS over conventional HMM's for our problem domain. 1 Introduction The human figure exhibits complex and rich dynamic behavior.

A New Approximate Maximal Margin,"A new incremental learning algorithm is described which approximates the maximal margin hyperplane w.r.t. norm p ~ 2 for a set of linearly separable data.

We apply it to both discrete and continuous sources. For the continuous source the underde termined (overcomplete) case is studied. The naive mean-field approach fails in this case whereas linear response theory-which gives an improved estimate of covariances-is very efficient. The examples given are for sources without temporal correlations. However, this derivation can eas ily be extended to treat temporal correlations. Finally, the framework offers a simple way of generating new leA algorithms without needing to define the prior distribution of the sources explicitly. 1 Introduction Reconstruction of statistically independent source signals from linear mixtures is an active research field.

Regularization with Dot-Product Kernels,"In this paper we give necessary and sufficient conditions under which kernels of dot product type k(x, y) = k(x . y) satisfy Mer cer's condition and thus may be used in Support Vector Ma chines (SVM), Regularization Networks (RN) or Gaussian Pro cesses (GP). In particular, we show that if the kernel is analytic (i.e. can be expanded in a Taylor series), all expansion coefficients have to be nonnegative. We give an explicit functional form for the feature map by calculating its eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. 1 Introduction Kernel functions are widely used in learning algorithms such as Support Vector Ma chines, Gaussian Processes, or Regularization Networks. A possible interpretation of their effects is that they represent dot products in some feature space :7, i.e. k(x,y) = Â¢(x)Â· Â¢(y) (1) where Â¢ is a map from input (data) space X into:7.

From Margin To Sparsity,"We present an improvement of Novikoff's perceptron convergence theorem. Reinterpreting this mistake bound as a margin dependent sparsity guarantee allows us to give a PAC-style generalisation er ror bound for the classifier learned by the perceptron learning algo rithm. The bound value crucially depends on the margin a support vector machine would achieve on the same data set using the same kernel. Ironically, the bound yields better guarantees than are cur rently available for the support vector solution itself. 1 Introduction In the last few years there has been a large controversy about the significance of the attained margin, i.e. the smallest real valued output of a classifiers before thresholding, as an indicator of generalisation performance. Results in the YC, PAC and luckiness frameworks seem to indicate that a large margin is a pre-requisite for small generalisation error bounds (see [14, 12]).

On a Connection between Kernel PCA,"In this paper we show that the kernel peA algorithm of Sch6lkopf et al (1998) can be interpreted as a form of metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) when the kernel function k(x, y) is isotropic, i.e. it depends only on Ilx - yll. This leads to a metric MDS algorithm where the desired configuration of points is found via the solution of an eigenproblem rather than through the iterative optimization of the stress objective function. The question of kernel choice is also discussed. 1 Introduction Suppose we are given n objects, and for each pair (i,j) we have a measurement of the ""dissimilarity"" Oij between the two objects. In multidimensional scaling (MDS) the aim is to place n points in a low dimensional space (usually Euclidean) so that the interpoint distances dij have a particular relationship to the original dissimilarities.

However, in contrast to HMMs, the IP model can handle duration modeling without an increase in computational complexity. 1 Introduction Hidden Markov models [9] have been a dominant paradigm in speech and handwrit ing recognition over the past several decades. The success of HMMs is primarily due to their ability to model the statistical and sequential nature of speech and handwriting data. However, HMMs have a number of weaknesses [2]. First, dis criminative powers of HMMs are weak since the training algorithm is based on a Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) criterion, whereas the optimal training should be based on a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) criterion [2].

One Microphone Source Separation,"Source separation, or computational auditory scene analysis, attempts to extract individual acoustic objects from input which contains a mixture of sounds from different sources, altered by the acoustic environment. Unmixing algorithms such as lCA and its extensions recover sources by reweighting multiple obser vation sequences, and thus cannot operate when only a single observation signal is available. I present a technique called refiltering which recovers sources by a nonstationary reweighting (""masking"") of frequency sub-bands from a single recording, and argue for the application of statistical algorithms to learning this masking function. I present results of a simple factorial HMM system which learns on recordings of single speakers and can then separate mixtures using only one observation signal by computing the masking function and then refiltering. 1 Learning from data in computational auditory scene analysis Imagine listening to many pianos being played simultaneously.

A new model of spatial representations In,"Most models of spatial representations in the cortex assume cells with limited receptive fields that are defined in a particular egocen tric frame of reference. However, cells outside of primary sensory cortex are either gain modulated by postural input or partially shifting. We show that solving classical spatial tasks, like sen sory prediction, multi-sensory integration, sensory-motor transfor mation and motor control requires more complicated intermediate representations that are not invariant in one frame of reference. We present an iterative basis function map that performs these spatial tasks optimally with gain modulated and partially shifting units, and tests it against neurophysiological and neuropsycholog ical data. In order to perform an action directed toward an object, it is necessary to have a representation of its spatial location. The brain must be able to use spatial cues coming from different modalities (e.g. vision, audition, touch, proprioception), combine them to i",Computer Vision,d757719ed7c2b66dd17dcee2a3cb29f4-Paper.pdf,2000
Feature Correspondence:,"When trying to recover 3D structure from a set of images, the most difficult problem is establishing the correspondence between the measurements. Most existing approaches assume that features can be tracked across frames, whereas methods that exploit rigidity constraints to facilitate matching do so only under restricted cam era motion. In this paper we propose a Bayesian approach that avoids the brittleness associated with singling out one ""best"" cor respondence, and instead consider the distribution over all possible correspondences. We treat both a fully Bayesian approach that yields a posterior distribution, and a MAP approach that makes use of EM to maximize this posterior. We show how Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be used to implement these techniques in practice, and present experimental results on real data. 1 Introduction Structure from motion (SFM) addresses the problem of simultaneously recovering camera pose and a three-dimensional model from a collection of images.

Stagewise processing in error-correcting,"We introduce stagewise processing in error-correcting codes and image restoration, by extracting information from the former stage and using it selectively to improve the performance of the latter one. Both mean-field analysis using the cavity method and sim ulations show that it has the advantage of being robust against uncertainties in hyperparameter estimation. 1 Introduction In error-correcting codes [1] and image restoration [2], the choice of the so-called hyperparameters is an important factor in determining their performances. Hyper parameters refer to the coefficients weighing the biases and variances of the tasks. In error correction, they determine the statistical significance given to the parity checking terms and the received bits. Similarly in image restoration, they determine the statistical weights given to the prior knowledge and the received data. It was shown, by the use of inequalities, that the choice of the hyperparameters is opti mal when there is a match between",Optimization & Theoretical ML,d7fd118e6f226a71b5f1ffe10efd0a78-Paper.pdf,2000
The Kernel Gibbs Sampler,"We present an algorithm that samples the hypothesis space of ker nel classifiers. Given a uniform prior over normalised weight vectors and a likelihood based on a model of label noise leads to a piece wise constant posterior that can be sampled by the kernel Gibbs sampler (KGS). The KGS is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that chooses a random direction in parameter space and samples from the resulting piecewise constant density along the line chosen. The KGS can be used as an analytical tool for the exploration of Bayesian transduction, Bayes point machines, active learning, and evidence-based model selection on small data sets that are contam inated with label noise. For a simple toy example we demonstrate experimentally how a Bayes point machine based on the KGS out performs an SVM that is incapable of taking into account label noise. 1 Introduction Two great ideas have dominated recent developments in machine learning: the ap plication of kernel methods and the popularisation of B",Optimization & Theoretical ML,dc40b7120e77741d191c0d2b82cea7be-Paper.pdf,2000
Learning Sparse Image Codes using a,"We show how a wavelet basis may be adapted to best represent natural images in terms of sparse coefficients. The wavelet basis, which may be either complete or overcomplete, is specified by a small number of spatial functions which are repeated across space and combined in a recursive fashion so as to be self-similar across scale. These functions are adapted to minimize the estimated code length under a model that assumes images are composed of a linear superposition of sparse, independent components. When adapted to natural images, the wavelet bases take on different orientations and they evenly tile the orientation domain, in stark contrast to the standard, non-oriented wavelet bases used in image compression. When the basis set is allowed to be overcomplete, it also yields higher coding efficiency than standard wavelet bases. 1 Introduction The general problem we address here is that of learning efficient codes for represent ing natural images.

Keeping flexible active contours on track using,"Condensation, a form of likelihood-weighted particle filtering, has been successfully used to infer the shapes of highly constrained ""active"" con tours in video sequences. However, when the contours are highly flexible (e.g. for tracking fingers of a hand), a computationally burdensome num ber of particles is needed to successfully approximate the contour distri bution. We show how the Metropolis algorithm can be used to update a particle set representing a distribution over contours at each frame in a video sequence. We compare this method to condensation using a video sequence that requires highly flexible contours, and show that the new algorithm performs dramatically better that the condensation algorithm. We discuss the incorporation of this method into the ""active contour"" framework where a shape-subspace is used constrain shape variation. 1 Introduction Tracking objects with flexible shapes in video sequences is currently an important topic in the vision community.

Weak Learners and Improved Rates of,"The problem of constructing weak classifiers for boosting algo rithms is studied. We present an algorithm that produces a linear classifier that is guaranteed to achieve an error better than random guessing for any distribution on the data. While this weak learner is not useful for learning in general, we show that under reasonable conditions on the distribution it yields an effective weak learner for one-dimensional problems. Preliminary simulations suggest that similar behavior can be expected in higher dimensions, a result which is corroborated by some recent theoretical bounds. Addi tionally, we provide improved convergence rate bounds for the gen eralization error in situations where the empirical error can be made small, which is exactly the situation that occurs if weak learners with guaranteed performance that is better than random guessing can be established. 1 Introduction The recently introduced boosting approach to classification (e.g., [10]) has been shown to be a highly e",Optimization & Theoretical ML,dea9ddb25cbf2352cf4dec30222a02a5-Paper.pdf,2000
Data clustering by Markovian relaxation,"We introduce a new, non-parametric and principled, distance based clustering method. This method combines a pairwise based ap proach with a vector-quantization method which provide a mean ingful interpretation to the resulting clusters. The idea is based on turning the distance matrix into a Markov process and then examine the decay of mutual-information during the relaxation of this process. The clusters emerge as quasi-stable structures dur ing this relaxation, and then are extracted using the information bottleneck method. These clusters capture the information about the initial point of the relaxation in the most effective way. The method can cluster data with no geometric or other bias and makes no assumption about the underlying distribution. 1 Introduction Data clustering is one of the most fundamental pattern recognition problems, with numerous algorithms and applications.

Balancing Multiple Sources of Reward in,"For many problems which would be natural for reinforcement learning, the reward signal is not a single scalar value but has multiple scalar com ponents. Examples of such problems include agents with multiple goals and agents with multiple users. Creating a single reward value by com bining the multiple components can throwaway vital information and can lead to incorrect solutions. We describe the multiple reward source problem and discuss the problems with applying traditional reinforce ment learning. We then present an new algorithm for finding a solution and results on simulated environments. 1 Introduction In the traditional reinforcement learning framework, the learning agent is given a single scalar value of reward at each time step. The goal is for the agent to optimize the sum of these rewards over time (the return). For many applications, there is more information available.

Analysis of Bit Error Probability of,"We analyze the bit error probability of multiuser demodulators for direct sequence binary phase-shift-keying (DSIBPSK) CDMA channel with ad ditive gaussian noise. The problem of multiuser demodulation is cast into the finite-temperature decoding problem, and replica analysis is ap plied to evaluate the performance of the resulting MPM (Marginal Pos terior Mode) demodulators, which include the optimal demodulator and the MAP demodulator as special cases. An approximate implementa tion of demodulators is proposed using analog-valued Hopfield model as a naive mean-field approximation to the MPM demodulators, and its performance is also evaluated by the replica analysis. Results of the per formance evaluation shows effectiveness of the optimal demodulator and the mean-field demodulator compared with the conventional one, espe cially in the cases of small information bit rate and low noise level. 1 Introduction The CDMA (Code-Division-Multiple-Access) technique [1] is important as a fundame",Optimization & Theoretical ML,e5b294b70c9647dcf804d7baa1903918-Paper.pdf,2000
Temporally Dependent Plasticity:,"The paradigm of Hebbian learning has recently received a novel in terpretation with the discovery of synaptic plasticity that depends on the relative timing of pre and post synaptic spikes. This paper derives a temporally dependent learning rule from the basic princi ple of mutual information maximization and studies its relation to the experimentally observed plasticity. We find that a supervised spike-dependent learning rule sharing similar structure with the ex perimentally observed plasticity increases mutual information to a stable near optimal level. Moreover, the analysis reveals how the temporal structure of time-dependent learning rules is determined by the temporal filter applied by neurons over their inputs.

Robust Reinforcement Learning,"This paper proposes a new reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that explicitly takes into account input disturbance as well as mod eling errors. The use of environmental models in RL is quite pop ular for both off-line learning by simulations and for on-line ac tion planning. However, the difference between the model and the real environment can lead to unpredictable, often unwanted results. Based on the theory of Hoocontrol, we consider a differential game in which a 'disturbing' agent (disturber) tries to make the worst possible disturbance while a 'control' agent (actor) tries to make the best control input. The problem is formulated as finding a min max solution of a value function that takes into account the norm of the output deviation and the norm of the disturbance. We derive on-line learning algorithms for estimating the value function and for calculating the worst disturbance and the best control in refer ence to the value function.

Explaining Away in Weight Space,"Explaining away has mostly been considered in terms of inference of states in belief networks.

Improved Output Coding for Classification,"Output coding is a general method for solving multiclass problems by reducing them to multiple binary classification problems. Previous re search on output coding has employed, almost solely, predefined discrete codes. We describe an algorithm that improves the performance of output codes by relaxing them to continuous codes. The relaxation procedure is cast as an optimization problem and is reminiscent of the quadratic program for support vector machines. We describe experiments with the proposed algorithm, comparing it to standard discrete output codes. The experimental results indicate that continuous relaxations of output codes often improve the generalization performance, especially for short codes. 1 Introduction The problem of multiclass categorization is about assigning labels to instances where the la bels are drawn from some finite set.

"Sequentially fitting ""inclusive"" trees for","An important class of problems can be cast as inference in noisy OR Bayesian networks, where the binary state of each variable is a logical OR of noisy versions of the states of the variable's par ents. For example, in medical diagnosis, the presence of a symptom can be expressed as a noisy-OR of the diseases that may cause the symptom - on some occasions, a disease may fail to activate the symptom. Inference in richly-connected noisy-OR networks is in tractable, but approximate methods (e.g., variational techniques) are showing increasing promise as practical solutions. One prob lem with most approximations is that they tend to concentrate on a relatively small number of modes in the true posterior, ig noring other plausible configurations of the hidden variables. We introduce a new sequential variational method for bipartite noisy OR networks, that favors including all modes of the true posterior and models the posterior distribution as a tree.

Whence Sparseness?,"It has been shown that the receptive fields of simple cells in VI can be ex plained by assuming optimal encoding, provided that an extra constraint of sparseness is added. This finding suggests that there is a reason, in dependent of optimal representation, for sparseness. However this work used an ad hoc model for the noise. Here I show that, if a biologically more plausible noise model, describing neurons as Poisson processes, is used sparseness does not have to be added as a constraint. Thus I con clude that sparseness is not a feature that evolution has striven for, but is simply the result of the evolutionary pressure towards an optimal repre sentation. 1 Introduction Recently there has been an resurgence of interest in using optimal coding strategies to 'explain' the response properties of neuron in the primary sensory areas [1]. Notably this approach was used Olshausen and Field [2] to infer the receptive field of simple cells in the primary visual cortex.

The front end emulates important aspects of auditory processing, such as cochlear filtering, nonlinear compression, and insensitivity to phase, with the aim of approaching the robustness of human listeners.

Combining ICA and top-down attention,"We present an algorithm which compensates for the mismatches between characteristics of real-world problems and assumptions of independent component analysis algorithm. To provide additional information to the ICA network, we incorporate top-down selec tive attention.

This backpropagation process results in estimation of expected ICA output signal for the top-down attention. Then, the unmixing matrix is retrained according to a new cost function representing the backpropagated error as well as independence.

Finally, we study the implications of one's choice of the prior and the parameterization and conclude that the smoothness scale determination makes density estimation very weakly sensitive to the choice of the prior, and that even wrong choices can be advantageous for small data sets. One of the central problems in learning is to balance 'goodness of fit' criteria against the complexity of models.

Neither the role of synaptic dynamics itself nor the role of the heterogeneity of synaptic dynamics for com putations in neural circuits is well understood. We present in this article methods that make it feasible to compute for a given synapse with known synaptic parameters the spike train that is optimally fitted to the synapse, for example in the sense that it produces the largest sum of postsynap tic responses.

Noise suppression based on,"A novel noise suppression scheme for speech signals is proposed which is based on a neurophysiologically-motivated estimation of the local signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in different frequency chan nels. For SNR-estimation, the input signal is transformed into so-called Amplitude Modulation Spectrograms (AMS), which rep resent both spectral and temporal characteristics of the respective analysis frame, and which imitate the representation of modula tion frequencies in higher stages of the mammalian auditory sys tem. A neural network is used to analyse AMS patterns generated from noisy speech and estimates the local SNR. Noise suppres sion is achieved by attenuating frequency channels according to their SNR. The noise suppression algorithm is evaluated in speaker independent digit recognition experiments and compared to noise suppression by Spectral Subtraction. 1 Introduction One of the major problems in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems is their lack of robustness in noise, whic",NLP,fc4ddc15f9f4b4b06ef7844d6bb53abf-Paper.pdf,2000
Dendritic compartmentalization could underlie,"Neurons in area V4 have relatively large receptive fields (RFs), so multi ple visual features are simultaneously ""seen"" by these cells. Recordings from single V 4 neurons suggest that simultaneously presented stimuli compete to set the output firing rate, and that attention acts to isolate individual features by biasing the competition in favor of the attended object. We propose that both stimulus competition and attentional bias ing arise from the spatial segregation of afferent synapses onto different regions of the excitable dendritic tree of V 4 neurons. The pattern of feed forward, stimulus-driven inputs follows from a Hebbian rule: excitatory afferents with similar RFs tend to group together on the dendritic tree, avoiding randomly located inhibitory inputs with similar RFs. The same principle guides the formation of inputs that mediate attentional mod ulation. Using both biophysically detailed compartmental models and simplified models of computation in single neurons, we demons",Computer Vision,ff1418e8cc993fe8abcfe3ce2003e5c5-Paper.pdf,2000
Smart Vision Chip Fabricated Using Three,"The smart VISIOn chip has a large potential for application in general purpose high speed image processing systems. In order to fabricate smart vision chips including photo detector compactly, we have proposed the application of three dimensional LSI technology for smart vision chips. Three dimensional technology has great potential to realize new neuromorphic systems inspired by not only the biological function but also the biological structure. In this paper, we describe our three dimensional LSI technology for neuromorphic circuits and the design of smart vision chips. 1 Introduction Recently, the demand for very fast image processing systems with real time operation capability has significantly increased. Conventional image processing systems based on the system level integration of a camera and a digital processor, do not have the potential for application in general purpose consumer electronic products. This is simply due to the cost, size and complexity of these systems. Therefo",Computer Vision,ff7d0f525b3be596a51fb919492c099c-Paper.pdf,2000
"A productive, systematic framework for","We describe a unified framework for the understanding of struc ture representation in primate vision. A model derived from this framework is shown to be effectively systematic in that it has the ability to interpret and associate together objects that are related through a rearrangement of common ""middle-scale"" parts, repre sented as image fragments. The model addresses the same concerns as previous work on compositional representation through the use of what+where receptive fields and attentional gain modulation. It does not require prior exposure to the individual parts, and avoids the need for abstract symbolic binding. 1 The problem of structure representation The focus of theoretical discussion in visual object processing has recently started to shift from problems of recognition and categorization to the representation of object structure. Although view- or appearance-based solutions for these problems proved effective on a variety of object classes [1], the ""holistic"" nature of ",Computer Vision,fface8385abbf94b4593a0ed53a0c70f-Paper.pdf,2000

Means. Correlations and Bounds,"The partition function for a Boltzmann machine can be bounded from above and below. We can use this to bound the means and the correlations. For networks with small weights, the values of these statistics can be restricted to non-trivial regions (i.e. a subset of [-1, 1]). Experimental results show that reasonable bounding occurs for weight sizes where mean field expansions generally give good results. 1 Introduction Over the last decade, bounding techniques have become a popular tool to deal with graphical models that are too complex for exact computation. A nice property of bounds is that they give at least some information you can rely on. For instance, one may find that a correlation is definitely between 0.4 and 0.6. An ordinary ap proximation might be more accurate, but in practical situations there is absolutely no warranty for that. The best known bound is probably the mean field bound, which has been described for Boltzmann machines in [1] and later for sigmoid belief networks",Optimization & Theoretical ML,0004d0b59e19461ff126e3a08a814c33-Paper.pdf,2001

Analysis of Sparse Bayesian Learning,"The recent introduction of the 'relevance vector machine' has effec tively demonstrated how sparsity may be obtained in generalised linear models within a Bayesian framework. Using a particular form of Gaussian parameter prior, 'learning' is the maximisation, with respect to hyperparameters, of the marginal likelihood of the data. This paper studies the properties of that objective func tion, and demonstrates that conditioned on an individual hyper parameter, the marginal likelihood has a unique maximum which is computable in closed form. It is further shown that if a derived 'sparsity criterion' is satisfied, this maximum is exactly equivalent to 'pruning' the corresponding parameter from the model. 1 Introduction We consider the approximation, from a training sample, of real-valued functions, a task variously referred to as prediction, regression, interpolation or function ap proximation.

Motivated Reinforcement Learning,"The standard reinforcement learning view of the involvement of neuromodulatory systems in instrumental conditioning in cludes a rather straightforward conception of motivation as prediction of sum future reward. Competition between actions is based on the motivating characteristics of their consequent states in this sense. Substantial, careful, experiments reviewed in Dickinson & Balleine, 12,13 into the neurobiology and psychol ogy of motivation shows that this view is incomplete. In many cases, animals are faced with the choice not between many dif ferent actions at a given state, but rather whether a single re sponse is worth executing at all. Evidence suggests that the motivational process underlying this choice has different psy chological and neural properties from that underlying action choice. We describe and model these motivational systems, and consider the way they interact. 1 Introduction Reinforcement learning (RL 28) bears a tortuous relationship with historical and conte",Reinforcement Learning,051928341be67dcba03f0e04104d9047-Paper.pdf,2001
A hierarchical model of complex cells in,"A cortical model for motion-in-depth selectivity of complex cells in the visual cortex is proposed. The model is based on a time ex tension of the phase-based techniques for disparity estimation. We consider the computation of the total temporal derivative of the time-varying disparity through the combination of the responses of disparity energy units. To take into account the physiological plau sibility, the model is based on the combinations of binocular cells characterized by different ocular dominance indices. The resulting cortical units of the model show a sharp selectivity for motion-in depth that has been compared with that reported in the literature for real cortical cells. 1 Introduction The analysis of a dynamic scene implies estimates of motion parameters to infer spatio-temporal information about the visual world. In particular, the perception of motion-in-depth (MID), i.e. the capability of discriminating between forward and backward movements of objects from an observer,",Computer Vision,03e7d2ebec1e820ac34d054df7e68f48-Paper.pdf,2001

Group Redundancy Measures Reveal,"The way groups of auditory neurons interact to code acoustic in formation is investigated using an information theoretic approach. We develop measures of redundancy among groups of neurons, and apply them to the study of collaborative coding efficiency in two processing stations in the auditory pathway: the inferior colliculus (IC) and the primary auditory cortex (AI). Under two schemes for the coding of the acoustic content, acoustic segments coding and stimulus identity coding, we show differences both in information content and group redundancies between IC and AI neurons. These results provide for the first time a direct evidence for redundancy reduction along the ascending auditory pathway, as has been hy pothesized for theoretical considerations [Barlow 1959,2001]. The redundancy effects under the single-spikes coding scheme are signif icant only for groups larger than ten cells, and cannot be revealed with the redundancy measures that use only pairs of cells.

The Noisy Euclidean Traveling Salesman,"We consider noisy Euclidean traveling salesman problems in the plane, which are random combinatorial problems with underlying structure. Gibbs sampling is used to compute average trajectories, which estimate the underlying structure common to all instances. This procedure requires identifying the exact relationship between permutations and tours. In a learning setting, the average trajec tory is used as a model to construct solutions to new instances sampled from the same source. Experimental results show that the average trajectory can in fact estimate the underlying structure and that overfitting effects occur if the trajectory adapts too closely to a single instance. 1 Introduction The approach in combinatorial optimization is traditionally single-instance and worst-case-oriented. An algorithm is tested against the worst possible single in stance.

Incorporating Invariances in Nonlinear,"The choice of an SVM kernel corresponds to the choice of a rep resentation of the data in a feature space and, to improve per formance, it should therefore incorporate prior knowledge such as known transformation invariances. We propose a technique which extends earlier work and aims at incorporating invariances in non linear kernels. We show on a digit recognition task that the pro posed approach is superior to the Virtual Support Vector method, which previously had been the method of choice. 1 Introduction In some classification tasks, an a priori knowledge is known about the invariances related to the task. For instance, in image classification, we know that the label of a given image should not change after a small translation or rotation. More generally, we assume we know a local transformation Lt depending on a parameter t (for instance, a vertical translation of t pixels) such that any point x should be considered equivalent to LtX, the transformed point.

Reinforcement Learning and Time,"Animal data on delayed-reward conditioning experiments shows a striking property - the data for different time intervals collapses into a single curve when the data is scaled by the time interval. This is called the scalar property of interval timing. Here a simple model of a neural clock is presented and shown to give rise to the scalar property. The model is an accumulator consisting of noisy, linear spiking neurons. It is analytically tractable and contains only three parameters. When coupled with reinforcement learning it simulates peak procedure experiments, producing both the scalar property and the pattern of single trial covariances. 1 Introduction An aspect of delayed-reward reinforcement learning problem which has a long his tory of study in animal experiments, but has been overlooked by theorists, is the learning of the expected time to the reward.

Computing Time Lower Bounds for,"Recurrent neural networks of analog units are computers for real valued functions. We study the time complexity of real computa tion in general recurrent neural networks. These have sigmoidal, linear, and product units of unlimited order as nodes and no re strictions on the weights. For networks operating in discrete time, we exhibit a family of functions with arbitrarily high complexity, and we derive almost tight bounds on the time required to compute these functions.

On Kernel-Target Alignment,"We introduce the notion of kernel-alignment, a measure of similar ity between two kernel functions or between a kernel and a target function. This quantity captures the degree of agreement between a kernel and a given learning task, and has very natural interpre tations in machine learning, leading also to simple algorithms for model selection and learning. We analyse its theoretical properties, proving that it is sharply concentrated around its expected value, and we discuss its relation with other standard measures of per formance. Finally we describe some of the algorithms that can be obtained within this framework, giving experimental results show ing that adapting the kernel to improve alignment on the labelled data significantly increases the alignment on the test set, giving improved classification accuracy. Hence, the approach provides a principled method of performing transduction.

Escaping the Convex Hull with,"Maximum margin classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) critically depends upon the convex hulls of the training samples of each class, as they implicitly search for the minimum distance between the convex hulls. We propose Extrapolated Vec tor Machines (XVMs) which rely on extrapolations outside these convex hulls. XVMs improve SVM generalization very significantly on the MNIST [7] OCR data. They share similarities with the Fisher discriminant: maximize the inter-class margin while mini mizing the intra-class disparity. 1 Introduction Both intuition and theory [9] seem to support that the best linear separation be tween two classes is the one that maximizes the margin. But is this always true? In the example shown in Fig.(l), the maximum margin hyperplane is Wo; however, most observers would say that the separating hyperplane WI has better chances to generalize, as it takes into account the expected location of additional training sam- â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ f\J:-â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ â¢â¢ ..,- -.Q",Computer Vision,23d2e1578544b172cca332ff74bddf5f-Paper.pdf,2001
Algorithmic Luckiness,"In contrast to standard statistical learning theory which studies uniform bounds on the expected error we present a framework that exploits the specific learning algorithm used. Motivated by the luckiness framework [8] we are also able to exploit the serendipity of the training sample. The main difference to previous approaches lies in the complexity measure; rather than covering all hypothe ses in a given hypothesis space it is only necessary to cover the functions which could have been learned using the fixed learning algorithm. We show how the resulting framework relates to the VC, luckiness and compression frameworks. Finally, we present an application of this framework to the maximum margin algorithm for linear classifiers which results in a bound that exploits both the margin and the distribution of the data in feature space. 1 Introduction Statistical learning theory is mainly concerned with the study of uniform bounds on the expected error of hypotheses from a given hypothesis ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,24f0d2c90473b2bc949ad962e61d9bcb-Paper.pdf,2001
Optimising Synchronisation Times for,"With the increasing number of users of mobile computing devices (e.g. personal digital assistants) and the advent of third generation mobile phones, wireless communications are becoming increasingly important. Many applications rely on the device maintaining a replica of a data-structure which is stored on a server, for exam ple news databases, calendars and e-mail. ill this paper we explore the question of the optimal strategy for synchronising such replicas. We utilise probabilistic models to represent how the data-structures evolve and to model user behaviour. We then formulate objective functions which can be minimised with respect to the synchronisa tion timings. We demonstrate, using two real world data-sets, that a user can obtain more up-to-date information using our approach. 1 Introduction As the available bandwidth for wireless devices increases, new challenges are pre sented in the utilisation of such bandwidth.

Why neuronal dynamics should control,"Hebbian learning rules are generally formulated as static rules. Un der changing condition (e.g. neuromodulation, input statistics) most rules are sensitive to parameters. In particular, recent work has focused on two different formulations of spike-timing-dependent plasticity rules. Additive STDP [1] is remarkably versatile but also very fragile, whereas multiplicative STDP [2, 3] is more ro bust but lacks attractive features such as synaptic competition and rate stabilization. Here we address the problem of robustness in the additive STDP rule. We derive an adaptive control scheme, where the learning function is under fast dynamic control by post synaptic activity to stabilize learning under a variety of conditions. Such a control scheme can be implemented using known biophysical mechanisms of synapses. We show that this adaptive rule makes the additive STDP more robust. Finally, we give an example how meta plasticity of the adaptive rule can be used to guide STDP into different type",Optimization & Theoretical ML,277a78fc05c8864a170e9a56ceeabc4c-Paper.pdf,2001
Latent Dirichlet Allocation,"We propose a generative model for text and other collections of dis crete data that generalizes or improves on several previous models including naive Bayes/unigram, mixture of unigrams [6], and Hof mann's aspect model, also known as probabilistic latent semantic indexing (pLSI) [3]. In the context of text modeling, our model posits that each document is generated as a mixture of topics, where the continuous-valued mixture proportions are distributed as a latent Dirichlet random variable. Inference and learning are carried out efficiently via variational algorithms. We present em pirical results on applications of this model to problems in text modeling, collaborative filtering, and text classification. 1 Introduction Recent years have seen the development and successful application of several latent factor models for discrete data. One notable example, Hofmann's pLSI/aspect model [3], has received the attention of many researchers, and applications have emerged in text modeling [3], c",NLP,296472c9542ad4d4788d543508116cbc-Paper.pdf,2001

We describe a situation in a real-world business application of machine-learning prediction in which an additional constraint is placed on the nature of the solu- tion: that the classifier achieve a specified correct acceptance or correct rejection rate (i.e., that it achieve a fixed accuracy on members of one class or the other). Our domain is predicting churn in the telecommunications industry. Churn refers to customers who switch from one service provider to another. We pro- pose four algorithms for training a classifier subject to this domain constraint, and present results showing that each algorithm yields a reliable improvement in performance. Although the improvement is modest in magnitude, it is nonethe- less impressive given the difficulty of the problem and the financial return that it achieves to the service provider.

A Model of the Phonological Loop:,"We present a neural network model that shows how the prefrontal cortex, interacting with the basal ganglia, can maintain a sequence of phonological information in activation-based working memory (i.e., the phonological loop). The primary function of this phono logical loop may be to transiently encode arbitrary bindings of information necessary for tasks - the combinatorial expressive power of language enables very flexible binding of essentially ar bitrary pieces of information. Our model takes advantage of the closed-class nature of phonemes, which allows different neural rep resentations of all possible phonemes at each sequential position to be encoded. To make this work, we suggest that the basal ganglia provide a region-specific update signal that allocates phonemes to the appropriate sequential coding slot. To demonstrate that flexi ble, arbitrary binding of novel sequences can be supported by this mechanism, we show that the model can generalize to novel se quences after modera",NLP,312351bff07989769097660a56395065-Paper.pdf,2001

A Parallel Mixture of SVMs for Very Large Scale,"Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are currently the state-of-the-art models for many classification problems but they suffer from the complexity of their train ing algorithm which is at least quadratic with respect to the number of examples. Hence, it is hopeless to try to solve real-life problems having more than a few hundreds of thousands examples with SVMs. The present paper proposes a new mixture of SVMs that can be easily implemented in parallel and where each SVM is trained on a small subset of the whole dataset. Experiments on a large benchmark dataset (Forest) as well as a difficult speech database, yielded significant time improvement (time complexity appears empirically to locally grow linearly with the number of examples). In addition, and that is a surprise, a significant improvement in generalization was observed on Forest. 1 Introduction Recently a lot of work has been done around Support Vector Machines [9], mainly due to their impressive generalization performances on cla",Optimization & Theoretical ML,36ac8e558ac7690b6f44e2cb5ef93322-Paper.pdf,2001

In contrast to standard methods we consider groups of neighboring samples (""patches"") within the observed mixtures. First we extract independent features from the observed patches.

We show that it might be the case that most of the dependencies is carried by only a small number of features. Is this case - provided these features can be identified by some heuristic - we project all patches into the subspace which is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the ""correlated"" features. Standard ICA is then performed on the elements of the transformed patches (for which the independence assumption holds) and ro bustly yields a good estimate of the mixing matrix. 1 Introduction ICA as a method for blind source sep",Optimization & Theoretical ML,3875115bacc48cca24ac51ee4b0e7975-Paper.pdf,2001

The later method can be applied in conjunction with any other ex isting technique which obtains a fixed bias solution. Moreover, the second method can also be used independently to solve the com plete SVM training problem. A combination of these two methods is more flexible than each individual method and, among other things, produces an incremental algorithm which exactly solve the 1-Norm Soft Margin SVM optimization problem.

We use a large real-world retail transaction data set to illustrate how these proflles consistently outperform non-mixture and non-Bayesian techniques in predicting customer behavior in out-of-sample data. 1 Introduction Transactiondatasetsconsistofrecordsofpairsofindividualsandevents,e.g.,items purchased (market basket data), telephone calls made (call records), or Web pages visited (from Web logs).

Learning spike-based correlations and,"We have designed and fabricated a VLSI synapse that can learn a conditional probability or correlation between spike-based inputs and feedback signals. The synapse is low power, compact, provides nonvolatile weight storage, and can perform simultaneous multipli- cation and adaptation. We can calibrate arrays of synapses to en- sure uniform adaptation characteristics. Finally, adaptation in our synapse does not necessarily depend on the signals used for com- putation. Consequently, our synapse can implement learning rules that correlate past and present synaptic activity. We provide analy- sis and experimental chip results demonstrating the operation in learning and calibration mode, and show how to use our synapse to implement various learning rules in silicon. 1 Introduction Computation with conditional probabilities and correlations underlies many models of neurally inspired information processing.

Spectral Kernel Methods for Clustering,"In this paper we introduce new algorithms for unsupervised learn ing based on the use of a kernel matrix. All the information re quired by such algorithms is contained in the eigenvectors of the matrix or of closely related matrices. We use two different but re lated cost functions, the Alignment and the 'cut cost'. The first one is discussed in a companion paper [3], the second one is based on graph theoretic concepts. Both functions measure the level of clustering of a labeled dataset, or the correlation between data clus ters and labels. We state the problem of unsupervised learning as assigning labels so as to optimize these cost functions. We show how the optimal solution can be approximated by slightly relaxing the corresponding optimization problem, and how this corresponds to using eigenvector information. The resulting simple algorithms are tested on real world data with positive results. 1 Introduction Kernel based learning provides a modular approach to learning system desig",Optimization & Theoretical ML,4ba29b9f9e5732ed33761840f4ba6c53-Paper.pdf,2001
A Natural Policy Gradient,"We provide a natural gradient method that represents the steepest descent direction based on the underlying structure of the param eter space. Although gradient methods cannot make large changes in the values of the parameters, we show that the natural gradi ent is moving toward choosing a greedy optimal action rather than just a better action. These greedy optimal actions are those that would be chosen under one improvement step of policy iteration with approximate, compatible value functions, as defined by Sut ton et al. [9]. We then show drastic performance improvements in simple MDPs and in the more challenging MDP of Tetris. 1 Introduction There has been a growing interest in direct policy-gradient methods for approximate planning in large Markov decision problems (MDPs). Such methods seek to find a good policy 7r among some restricted class of policies, by following the gradient of the future reward. Unfortunately, the standard gradient descent rule is non covariant.

Analog Soft-Pattern-Matching Classifier,"A flexible pattern-matching analog classifier is presented in con- junction with a robust image representation algorithm called Prin- cipal Axes Projection (PAP). In the circuit, the functional form of matching is configurable in terms of the peak position, the peak height and the sharpness of the similarity evaluation. The test chip was fabri- cated in a 0.6-m m CMOS technology and successfully applied to hand-written pattern recognition and medical radiograph analysis using PAP as a feature extraction pre-processing step for robust image coding. The separation and classification of overlapping patterns is also ex- perimentally demonstrated. 1 Introduction Pattern classification using template matching techniques is a powerful tool in im- plementing human-like intelligent systems. However, the processing is computa- tionally very expensive, consuming a lot of CPU time when implemented as soft- ware running on general-purpose computers.

On the Concentration of Spectral,"We consider the problem of measuring the eigenvalues of a ran domly drawn sample of points. We show that these values can be reliably estimated as can the sum of the tail of eigenvalues. Fur thermore, the residuals when data is projected into a subspace is shown to be reliably estimated on a random sample. Experiments are presented that confirm the theoretical results. 1 Introduction A number of learning algorithms rely on estimating spectral data on a sample of training points and using this data as input to further analyses. For example in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) the subspace spanned by the first k eigen vectors is used to give a k dimensional model of the data with minimal residual, hence forming a low dimensional representation of the data for analysis or clus tering. Recently the approach has been applied in kernel defined feature spaces in what has become known as kernel-PCA [5].

Pranking with Ranking,"We discuss the problem of ranking instances. In our framework each instance is associated with a rank or a rating, which is an integer from 1 to k.

Asymptotic Universality for Learning,"Using methods of Statistical Physics, we investigate the rOle of model complexity in learning with support vector machines (SVMs). We show the advantages of using SVMs with kernels of infinite complexity on noisy target rules, which, in contrast to common theoretical beliefs, are found to achieve optimal general ization error although the training error does not converge to the generalization error. Moreover, we find a universal asymptotics of the learning curves which only depend on the target rule but not on the SVM kernel. 1 Introduction Powerful systems for data inference, like neural networks implement complex input output relations by learning from example data. The price one has to pay for the flexibility of these models is the need to choose the proper model complexity for a given task, i.e. the system architecture which gives good generalization ability for novel data. This has become an important problem also for support vector machines [1]. The main advantage of SVMs is that",Optimization & Theoretical ML,5a1e3a5aede16d438c38862cac1a78db-Paper.pdf,2001
Active Information Retrieval,"In classical large information retrieval systems, the system responds to a user initiated query with a list of results ranked by relevance. The users may further refine their query as needed. This process may result in a lengthy correspondence without conclusion. We propose an alternative active learning approach, where the sys tem responds to the initial user's query by successively probing the user for distinctions at multiple levels of abstraction. The system's initiated queries are optimized for speedy recovery and the user is permitted to respond with multiple selections or may reject the query. The information is in each case unambiguously incorporated by the system and the subsequent queries are adjusted to minimize the need for further exchange. The system's initiated queries are subject to resource constraints pertaining to the amount of infor mation that can be presented to the user per iteration. 1 Introduction An IR system consists of a collection of documents and an engine",Optimization & Theoretical ML,5a7f963e5e0504740c3a6b10bb6d4fa5-Paper.pdf,2001

Geometrical Singularities in the,"Singularities are ubiquitous in the parameter space of hierarchical models such as multilayer perceptrons. At singularities, the Fisher information matrix degenerates, and the Cramer-Rao paradigm does no more hold, implying that the classical model selection the ory such as AIC and MDL cannot be applied. It is important to study the relation between the generalization error and the training error at singularities. The present paper demonstrates a method of analyzing these errors both for the maximum likelihood estima tor and the Bayesian predictive distribution in terms of Gaussian random fields, by using simple models. 1 Introduction A neural network is specified by a number of parameters which are synaptic weights and biases.

Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filtering,"In this paper, we extend the Rao-Blackwellised particle filtering method to more complex hybrid models consisting of Gaussian la tent variables and discrete observations. This is accomplished by augmenting the models with artificial variables that enable us to apply Rao-Blackwellisation. Other improvements include the de sign of an optimal importance proposal distribution and being able to swap the sampling an selection steps to handle outliers. We focus on sequential binary classifiers that consist of linear combinations of basis functions, whose coefficients evolve according to a Gaussian smoothness prior. Our results show significant improvements. 1 Introduction Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) particle methods go back to the first publically available paper in the modern field of Monte Carlo simulation (Metropolis and Ulam 1949); see (Doucet, de Freitas and Gordon 2001) for a comprehensive review.

This stems from the observation- which is borne out in repeated experiments- that while discriminative learning has lower asymptotic error, a generative classifier may also approach its (higher) asymptotic error much faster. 1 Introduction Generative classifiers learn a model of the joint probability, p( x, y), of the inputs x and the label y, and make their predictions by using Bayes rules to calculate p(ylx), and then picking the most likely label y. Discriminative classifiers model the pos terior p(ylx) directly, or learn a direct map from inputs x to the class labels. There are several compelling reasons for using discriminative rather ",NLP,7b7a53e239400a13bd6be6c91c4f6c4e-Paper.pdf,2001

On Spectral Clustering:,"Despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methods algorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices de rived from the data- there are several unresolved issues. First, there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. Second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. In this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of Matlab. Using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. We also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems. 1 Introduction The task of finding good clusters has been the focus of considerable research in machine learning and pattern recognition.

The model is based upon grammat ical bigrams, i.e., syntactic relationships between pairs of words. We present the results of experiments that quantify the represen tational adequacy of the grammatical bigram model, its ability to generalize from labelled data, and its ability to induce syntactic structure from large amounts of raw text. 1 Introduction One of the most significant challenges in learning grammars from raw text is keep ing the computational complexity manageable.

An advantage ofthis approach is that batch value-function fitting is a global process, which allows it to address the tradeoffs in function approximation that cannot be handled by local, online algorithms. This approach was pioneered by Boyan and Moore with their GROWSUPPORT and ROUT al gorithms.

Tree-based reparameterization for,"We develop a tree-based reparameterization framework that pro vides a new conceptual view of a large class of iterative algorithms for computing approximate marginals in graphs with cycles. It includes belief propagation (BP), which can be reformulated as a very local form of reparameterization. More generally, we consider algorithms that perform exact computations over spanning trees of the full graph. On the practical side, we find that such tree reparameterization (TRP) algorithms have convergence properties superior to BP. The reparameterization perspective also provides a number of theoretical insights into approximate inference, in cluding a new characterization of fixed points; and an invariance intrinsic to TRP /BP. These two properties enable us to analyze and bound the error between the TRP /BP approximations and the actual marginals. While our results arise naturally from the TRP perspective, most of them apply in an algorithm-independent manner to any local minimum of the B",Optimization & Theoretical ML,9185f3ec501c674c7c788464a36e7fb3-Paper.pdf,2001
Semi-Supervised MarginBoost,"In many discrimination problems a large amount of data is available but only a few of them are labeled. This provides a strong motivation to improve or develop methods for semi-supervised learning. In this paper, boosting is generalized to this task within the optimization framework of MarginBoost . We extend the margin definition to unlabeled data and develop the gradient descent algorithm that corresponds to the resulting margin cost function. This meta-learning scheme can be applied to any base classifier able to benefit from unlabeled data. We propose here to apply it to mixture models trained with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Promising results are presented on benchmarks with different rates of labeled data. 1 Introduction In semi-supervised classification tasks, a concept is to be learnt using both labeled and unlabeled examples.

In previous work published in Eurospeech, we showed how a probability model trained on clean speech and a separate probability model trained on noise could be combined for the purpose of estimating the noise free speech from the noisy speech. We showed how an iterative 2nd order vector Taylor series approximation could be used for prob abilistic inference in this model. In many circumstances, it is not possible to obtain examples of noise without speech. Noise statis tics may change significantly during an utterance, so that speech free frames are not sufficient for estimating the noise model.

Adaptive N earest Neighbor Classification,"The nearest neighbor technique is a simple and appealing method to address classification problems. It relies on the assumption of locally constant class conditional probabilities. This assumption becomes invalid in high dimensions with a finite number of exam ples due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose a technique that computes a locally flexible metric by means of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The maximum margin boundary found by the SVM is used to determine the most discriminant direction over the query's neighborhood. Such direction provides a local weighting scheme for input features.

Relative Density Nets: A New Way to,"Logistic units in the first hidden layer of a feedforward neural net work compute the relative probability of a data point under two Gaussians. This leads us to consider substituting other density models. We present an architecture for performing discriminative learning of Hidden Markov Models using a network of many small HMM's. Experiments on speech data show it to be superior to the standard method of discriminatively training HMM's. 1 Introduction A standard way of performing classification using a generative model is to divide the training cases into their respective classes and then train a set of class conditional models. This unsupervised approach to classification is appealing for two reasons. It is possible to reduce overfitting, because the model learns the class-conditional input densities P(xlc) rather than the input-conditional class probabilities P(clx). Also, provided that the model density is a good match to the underlying data density then the decision provided by a p",Computer Vision,9bb6dee73b8b0ca97466ccb24fff3139-Paper.pdf,2001
Neural Implementation of Bayesian,"This study investigates a population decoding paradigm, in which the estimation of stimulus in the previous step is used as prior knowledge for consecutive decoding. We analyze the decoding accu racy of such a Bayesian decoder (Maximum a Posteriori Estimate), and show that it can be implemented by a biologically plausible recurrent network, where the prior knowledge of stimulus is con veyed by the change in recurrent interactions as a result of Hebbian learning. 1 Introduction Information in the brain is not processed by a single neuron, but rather by a popu lation of them. Such a coding strategy is called population coding. It is conceivable that population coding has advantage of being robust to the fluctuation in a single neuron's activity. However, people argue that population coding may have other computationally desirable properties. One such property is to provide a framework for encoding complex objects by using basis functions [1].

The Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP),"We introduce the Concave-Convex procedure (CCCP) which con structs discrete time iterative dynamical systems which are guar anteed to monotonically decrease global optimization/energy func tions. It can be applied to (almost) any optimization problem and many existing algorithms can be interpreted in terms of CCCP. In particular, we prove relationships to some applications of Legendre transform techniques. We then illustrate CCCP by applications to Potts models, linear assignment, EM algorithms, and Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS). CCCP can be used both as a new way to understand existing optimization algorithms and as a procedure for generating new algorithms. 1 Introduction There is a lot of interest in designing discrete time dynamical systems for inference and learning (see, for example, [10], [3], [7], [13]). This paper describes a simple geometrical Concave-Convex procedure (CCCP) for constructing discrete time dynamical systems which can be guaranteed to decrease almost any ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,a012869311d64a44b5a0d567cd20de04-Paper.pdf,2001

Activity Driven Adaptive Stochastic,"Cortical neurons might be considered as threshold elements inte grating in parallel many excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Due to the apparent variability of cortical spike trains this yields a strongly fluctuating membrane potential, such that threshold crossings are highly irregular. Here we study how a neuron could maximize its sensitivity w.r.t. a relatively small subset of excitatory input. Weak signals embedded in fluctuations is the natural realm of stochastic resonance. The neuron's response is described in a hazard-function approximation applied to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We an alytically derive an optimality criterium and give a learning rule for the adjustment of the membrane fluctuations, such that the sensitivity is maximal exploiting stochastic resonance. We show that adaptation depends only on quantities that could easily be estimated locally (in space and time) by the neuron. The main results are compared with simulations of a biophysically more re alistic neuron",Optimization & Theoretical ML,a29d1598024f9e87beab4b98411d48ce-Paper.pdf,2001
Reinforcement Learning,"This paper presents reinforcement learning with a Long Short Term Memory recurrent neural network: RL-LSTM. Model-free RL-LSTM using Advantage(,x) learning and directed exploration can solve non-Markovian tasks with long-term dependencies be tween relevant events. This is demonstrated in a T-maze task, as well as in a difficult variation ofthe pole balancingtask. 1 Introduction Reinforcement learning (RL) is a way oflearning how to behave based on delayed reward signals [12]. Among the more important challenges for RL are tasks where part ofthe state ofthe environment is hidden from the agent. Suchtasks are called non-MarkoviantasksorPartiallyObservableMarkovDecisionProcesses. Manyreal world tasks have this problem of hidden state. For instance, in a navigation task different positions in the environment may look the same, but one and the same action may lead to different next states or rewards. Thus, hidden state makes RL more realistic. However, it also makes it more difficult, becau",Reinforcement Learning,a38b16173474ba8b1a95bcbc30d3b8a5-Paper.pdf,2001
The Intelligent Surfer:,"The PageRank algorithm, used in the Google search engine, greatly improves the results of Web search by taking into account the link structure of the Web. PageRank assigns to a page a score propor- tional to the number of times a random surfer would visit that page, if it surfed indefinitely from page to page, following all outlinks from a page with equal probability. We propose to improve Page- Rank by using a more intelligent surfer, one that is guided by a probabilistic model of the relevance of a page to a query. Efficient execution of our algorithm at query time is made possible by pre- computing at crawl time (and thus once for all queries) the neces- sary terms. Experiments on two large subsets of the Web indicate that our algorithm significantly outperforms PageRank in the (hu- man-rated) quality of the pages returned, while remaining efficient enough to be used in todayâs large search engines. 1 Introduction Traditional information retrieval techniques can give poor results on",Optimization & Theoretical ML,a501bebf79d570651ff601788ea9d16d-Paper.pdf,2001
ADynamic HMM for On-line,"We propose a novel method for the analysis of sequential data that exhibits an inherent mode switching. In particular, the data might be a non-stationary time series from a dynamical system that switches between multiple operating modes. Unlike other ap proaches, our method processes the data incrementally and without any training of internal parameters. We use an HMM with a dy namically changing number of states and an on-line variant of the Viterbi algorithm that performs an unsupervised segmentation and classification of the data on-the-fly, i.e. the method is able to pro cess incoming data in real-time. The main idea of the approach is to track and segment changes of the probability density of the data in a sliding window on the incoming data stream. The usefulness of the algorithm is demonstrated by an application to a switching dynamical system. 1 Introduction Abrupt changes can occur in many different real-world systems like, for example, in speech, in climatological or industri",Computer Vision,a48564053b3c7b54800246348c7fa4a0-Paper.pdf,2001

It fails when the data is divided into separate groups. We study a variant of LLE that can simultaneously group the data and calculate local embedding of each group.

Suppose that, while the dimension D is large, we have independent information suggesting that the data are distributed on a manifold of dimension d < < D. In many circumstances it is beneficial to calculate the coordinates Yi E ]Rd of the data on the lower-dimensional manifold, both because the shape of the manifold may yield some insight in the process that produced the data, and because it is cheaper to store and manipulate the data when it is embedded in fewer dimensions.

Associative memory in realistic neuronal,"Almost two decades ago, Hopfield [1] showed that networks of highly reduced model neurons can exhibit multiple attracting fixed points, thus providing a substrate for associative memory. It is still not clear, however, whether realistic neuronal networks can support multiple attractors. The main difficulty is that neuronal networks in vivo exhibit a stable background state at low firing rate, typ ically a few Hz. Embedding attractor is easy; doing so without destabilizing the background is not. Previous work [2,3] focused on the sparse coding limit, in which a vanishingly small number of neurons are involved in any memory. Here we investigate the case in which the number of neurons involved in a memory scales with the number of neurons in the network. In contrast to the sparse coding limit, we find that multiple attractors can co-exist robustly with a stable background state. Mean field theory is used to under stand how the behavior of the network scales with its parameters, and simula",Computer Vision,a96d3afec184766bfeca7a9f989fc7e7-Paper.pdf,2001

Direct value-approxiIllation for factored MDPs,"We present a simple approach for computing reasonable policies for factored Markov decision processes (MDPs), when the opti malvaluefunction canbe approximatedbya compact linearform. Our method is based on solving a single linear program that ap proximates the best linear fit to the optimal value function. By applying an efficient constraint generation procedure we obtain an iterativesolutionmethodthattacklesconciselinearprograms. This direct linear programmingapproach experimentallyyields a signif icant reduction in computation time over approximate value- and policy-iteration methods (sometimes reducing several hours to a few seconds). However, the quality of the solutions produced by linear programming is weaker-usually about twice the approxi mation error for the same approximating class. Nevertheless, the speed advantage allows one to use larger approximationclasses to achieve similarerror in reasonable time. 1 Introduction Markov decision processes (MDPs) form a foundation for co",Reinforcement Learning,b3b4d2dbedc99fe843fd3dedb02f086f-Paper.pdf,2001
Perceptual Metamers,"Theories of cue combination suggest the possibility of constructing visual stimuli that evoke different patterns of neural activity in sensory areas of the brain, but that cannot be distinguished by any behavioral measure of perception. Such stimuli, if they exist, would be interesting for two reasons. First, one could know that none of the differences between the stimuli survive past the computations used to build the percepts. Second, it can be difficult to distinguish stimulus-driven components of measured neural activity from top-down components (such as those due to the interestingness of the stimuli). Changing the stimulus without changing the percept could be exploited to measure the stimulus- driven activity. Here we describe stimuli in which vertical and horizontal disparities trade during the construction of percepts of slanted surfaces, yielding stimulus equivalence classes.

Adam Kepecs* and Sridhar Raghavachari,"Neurons receive excitatory inputs via both fast AMPA and slow NMDA type receptors. We find that neurons receiving input via NMDA receptors can have two stable membrane states which are input dependent. Action potentials can only be initiated from the higher voltage state. Similar observations have been made in sev eral brain areas which might be explained by our model. The in teractions between the two kinds of inputs lead us to suggest that some neurons may operate in 3 states: disabled, enabled and fir ing. Such enabled, but non-firing modes can be used to introduce context-dependent processing in neural networks. We provide a simple example and discuss possible implications for neuronal pro cessing and response variability. 1 Introduction Excitatory interactions between neurons are mediated by two classes of synapses: AMPA and NMDA.

A Neural Oscillator Model of Auditory,"A model of auditory grouping is described in which auditory attention plays a key role. The model is based upon an oscillatory correlation framework, in which neural oscillators representing a single perceptual stream are synchronised, and are desynchronised from oscillators representing other streams. The model suggests a mechanism by which attention can be directed to the high or low tones in a repeating sequence of tones with alternating frequencies. In addition, it simulates the perceptual segregation of a mistuned harmonic from a complex tone. 1 Introduction In virtually all listening situations, we are exposed to a mixture of sound energy from multiple sources. Hence, the auditory system must separate an acoustic mixture in order to create a perceptual description of each sound source. It has been proposed that this process of auditory scene analysis (ASA) [2] takes place in two conceptual stages: segmentation in which the acoustic mixture is separated into its constituent âatomi",Computer Vision,c3535febaff29fcb7c0d20cbe94391c7-Paper.pdf,2001

"An Efficient, Exact Algorithm for Solving","We describe a new algorithm for computing a Nash equilibrium in graphical games, a compact representation for multi-agent systems that we introduced in previous work. The algorithm is the first to compute equilibria both efficiently and exactly for a non-trivial class of graphical games. 1 Introduction Seeking to replicate the representational and computational benefits that graph ical models have provided to probabilistic inference, several recent works have introduced graph-theoretic frameworks for the study of multi-agent sys tems (La Mura 2000; Koller and Milch 2001; Kearns et al. 2001). In the simplest of these formalisms, each vertex represents a single agent, and the edges represent pairwise interaction between agents. As with many familiar network models, the macroscopic behavior of a large system is thus implicitly described by its local inter actions, and the computational challenge is to extract the global states of interest.

Causal Categorization with Bayes Nets,"A theory of categorization is presented in which knowledge of causal relationships between category features is represented as a Bayesian network. Referred to as causal-model theory, this theory predicts that objects are classified as category members to the extent they are likely to have been produced by a categorys causal model. On this view, people have models of the world that lead them to expect a certain distribution of features in category members (e.g., correlations between feature pairs that are directly connected by causal relationships), and consider exemplars good category members when they manifest those expectations. These expectations include sensitivity to higher-order feature interactions that emerge from the asymmetries inherent in causal relationships. Research on the topic of categorization has traditionally focused on the problem of learning new categories given observations of category members. In contrast, the theory-based view of categories emphasizes the influe",NLP,c5a4e7e6882845ea7bb4d9462868219b-Paper.pdf,2001

Covariance Kernels from Bayesian,"We propose the framework of mutual information kernels for learning covariance kernels, as used in Support Vector machines and Gaussian process classifiers, from unlabeled task data using Bayesian techniques. We describe an implementation of this frame work which uses variational Bayesian mixtures of factor analyzers in order to attack classification problems in high-dimensional spaces where labeled data is sparse, but unlabeled data is abundant. 1 Introduction Kernel machines, such as Support Vector machines or Gaussian processes, are pow erful and frequently used tools for solving statistical learning problems. They are based on the use of a kernel function which encodes task prior knowledge in a Bayesian manner. In this paper, we propose the framework of mutual informa tion (MI) kernels for learning covariance kernels from unlabeled task data using Bayesian techniques.

Modeling Temporal Structure in Classical,"The Temporal Coding Hypothesis of Miller and colleagues [7] sug gests that animals integrate related temporal patterns of stimuli into single memory representations. We formalize this concept using quasi-Bayes estimation to update the parameters of a con strained hidden Markov model. This approach allows us to account for some surprising temporal effects in the second order condition ing experiments of Miller et al. [1, 2, 3], which other models are unable to explain. 1 Introduction Animal learning involves more than just predicting reinforcement. The well-known phenomena of latent learning and sensory preconditioning indicate that animals learn about stimuli in their environment before any reinforcement is supplied. More recently, a series of experiments by R. R. Miller and colleagues has demonstrated that in classical conditioning paradigms, animals appear to learn the temporal struc ture of the stimuli [8].

Modeling the Modulatory Effect of,"We present new simulation results, in which a computational model of interacting visual neurons simultaneously predicts the modula tion of spatial vision thresholds by focal visual attention, for five dual-task human psychophysics experiments. This new study com plements our previous findings that attention activates a winner take-all competition among early visual neurons within one cortical hypercolumn. This ""intensified competition"" hypothesis assumed that attention equally affects all neurons, and yielded two single unit predictions: an increase in gain and a sharpening of tuning with attention. While both effects have been separately observed in electrophysiology, no single-unit study has yet shown them si multaneously. Hence, we here explore whether our model could still predict our data if attention might only modulate neuronal gain, but do so non-uniformly across neurons and tasks. Specifically, we investigate whether modulating the gain of only the neurons that are loudest, be",Computer Vision,cbef46321026d8404bc3216d4774c8a9-Paper.pdf,2001
Approximate Dynamic Programming,"The curse of dimensionality gives rise to prohibitive computational requirements that render infeasible the exact solution of large-scale stochastic control problems. We study an efficient method based on linear programming for approximating solutions to such prob lems. The approach ""fits"" a linear combination of pre-selected basis functions to the dynamic programming cost-to-go function. We develop bounds on the approximation error and present experi mental results in the domain of queueing network control, providing empirical support for the methodology. 1 Introduction Dynamic programming offers a unified approach to solving problems of stochastic control. Central to the methodology is the cost-to-go function, which can obtained via solving Bellman's equation. The domain of the cost-to-go function is the state space of the system to be controlled, and dynamic programming algorithms com pute and store a table consisting of one cost-to-go value per state.

A New Discriminative Kernel From Probabilistic Models,"Recently, Jaakkola and Haussler proposed a method for construct ing kernel functions from probabilistic models. Their so called ""Fisher kernel"" has been combined with discriminative classifiers such as SVM and applied successfully in e.g. DNA and protein analysis. Whereas the Fisher kernel (FK) is calculated from the marginal log-likelihood, we propose the TOP kernel derived from Tangent vectors Of Posterior log-odds. Furthermore we develop a theoretical framework on feature extractors from probabilistic models and use it for analyzing FK and TOP. In experiments our new discriminative TOP kernel compares favorably to the Fisher kernel. 1 Introduction In classification tasks, learning enables us to predict the output y E {-1, + 1} of some unknown system given the input a!

Receptive field structure of flow detectors,"Observer translation relative to the world creates image flow that expands from the observer's direction of translation (heading) from which the observer can recover heading direction. Yet, the image flow is often more complex, depending on rotation of the eye, scene layout and translation velocity. A number of models [1-4] have been proposed on how the human visual system extracts heading from flow in a neurophysiologic ally plausible way. These models represent heading by a set of neurons that respond to large image flow patterns and receive input from motion sensed at different im age locations. We analysed these models to determine the exact receptive field of these heading detectors. We find most models predict that, contrary to widespread believe, the contributing mo tion sensors have a preferred motion directed circularly rather than radially around the detector's preferred heading. Moreover, the re sults suggest to look for more refined structure within the circular flow, such ",Computer Vision,d198bd736a97e7cecfdf8f4f2027ef80-Paper.pdf,2001
Bayesian morphometry of hippocampal cells,"Visual inspection of neurons suggests that dendritic orientation may be determined both by internal constraints (e.g. membrane tension) and by external vector fields (e.g. neurotrophic gradients). For example, basal dendrites of pyramidal cells appear nicely fan-out. This regular orientation is hard to justify completely with a general tendency to grow straight, given the zigzags observed experimentally. Instead, dendrites could (A) favor a fixed (âexternalâ) direction, or (B) repel from their own soma. To investigate these possibilities quantitatively, reconstructed hippocampal cells were subjected to Bayesian analysis. The statistical model combined linearly factors A and B, as well as the tendency to grow straight. For all morphological classes, B was found to be significantly positive and consistently greater than A. In addition, when dendrites were artificially re-oriented according to this model, the resulting structures closely resembled real morphologies.

This sug gests the utility of audio-visual information for the task of speech enhancement. We propose a method to exploit audio-visual cues to enable speech separation under non-stationary noise and with a single microphone. We revise and extend HMM-based speech enhancement techniques, in which signal and noise models are fac tori ally combined, to incorporate visual lip information and em ploy novel signal HMMs in which the dynamics of narrow-band and wide band components are factorial. We avoid the combina torial explosion in the factorial model by using a simple approxi mate inference technique to quickly estimate the clean signals in a mixture. We present a preliminary evaluation of this approach using a small-vocabulary audio-visual database, showing promising improvements in machine intelligibility for speech enhanced using audio and visual information. 1 Introductio",Computer Vision,d47268e9db2e9aa3827bba3afb7ff94a-Paper.pdf,2001

Spectral Relaxation for K-means,"The popular K-means clustering partitions a data set by minimiz ing a sum-of-squares cost function. A coordinate descend method is then used to find local minima. In this paper we show that the minimization can be reformulated as a trace maximization problem associated with the Gram matrix of the data vectors. Furthermore, we show that a relaxed version of the trace maximization problem possesses global optimal solutions which can be obtained by com puting a partial eigendecomposition of the Gram matrix, and the cluster assignment for each data vectors can be found by comput ing a pivoted QR decomposition of the eigenvector matrix. As a by-product we also derive a lower bound for the minimum of the sum-of-squares cost function. 1 Introduction K-means is a very popular method for general clustering [6].

I derive approximations to the learning curves for the more generic case of mismatched models, and find very rich behaviour: For large input space dimensionality, where the results become exact, there are universal (student-independent) plateaux in the learning curve, with transitions in between that can exhibit arbitrarily many over-fitting maxima; over-fitting can occur even if the student estimates the teacher noise level correctly. In lower dimensions, plateaux also appear, and the learning curve remains dependent on the mismatch between student and teacher even in the asymptotic limit of a large number of training examples.

Speech Recognition using SVMs,"An important issue in applying SVMs to speech recognition is the ability to classify variable length sequences. This paper presents extensions to a standard scheme for handling this variable length data, the Fisher score. A more useful mapping is introduced based on the likelihood-ratio. The score-space defined by this mapping avoids some limitations of the Fisher score. Class-conditional gen erative models are directly incorporated into the definition of the score-space. The mapping, and appropriate normalisation schemes, are evaluated on a speaker-independent isolated letter task where the new mapping outperforms both the Fisher score and HMMs trained to maximise likelihood. 1 Introduction Speech recognition is a complex, dynamic classification task.

EM-DD is relatively insensitive to the number of relevant attributes in the data set and scales up well to large bag sizes. Furthermore, EM DD provides a new framework for MI learning, in which the MI problem is converted to a single-instance setting by using EM to estimate the instance responsible for the label of the bag. 1 Introduction The multiple-instance (MI) learning model has received much attention.

Simulation results show that it is efficient and precise, when compared with cross-validation and other techniques which require matrix inversion. 1 Introduction It is well known that correct choices of hyperparameters in classification and regres sion tasks can optimize the complexity of the data model, and hence achieve the best generalization [1]. In recent years various methods have been proposed to esti mate the optimal hyperparameters in different contexts, such as neural networks [2], support vector machines [3, 4, 5] and Gaussian processes [5]. Most of these meth ods are inspired by the technique of cross-validation or its variant, leave-one-out validation. While the leave-one-out procedure gives an almost unbiased estimate of the generalization error, it is nevertheless very tedious",Optimization & Theoretical ML,e7e23670481ac78b3c4122a99ba60573-Paper.pdf,2001
Learning Body Pose via Specialized Maps,"A nonlinear supervised learning model, the Specialized Mappings Architecture (SMA), is described and applied to the estimation of human body pose from monocular images. The SMA consists of several specialized forward mapping functions and an inverse map ping function. Each specialized function maps certain domains of the input space (image features) onto the output space (body pose parameters). The key algorithmic problems faced are those of learning the specialized domains and mapping functions in an op timal way, as well as performing inference given inputs and knowl edge of the inverse function. Solutions to these problems employ the EM algorithm and alternating choices of conditional indepen dence assumptions. Performance of the approach is evaluated with synthetic and real video sequences of human motion. 1 Introduction In everyday life, humans can easily estimate body part locations (body pose) from relatively low-resolution images of the projected 3D world (e.g., when viewing a ",Computer Vision,ea6b2efbdd4255a9f1b3bbc6399b58f4-Paper.pdf,2001
Information-geometric decomposition In,"We present an information-geometric measure to systematically investigate neuronal firing patterns, taking account not only of the second-order but also of higher-order interactions. We begin with the case of two neurons for illustration and show how to test whether or not any pairwise correlation in one period is significantly different from that in the other period. In order to test such a hy pothesis of different firing rates, the correlation term needs to be singled out 'orthogonally' to the firing rates, where the null hypoth esis might not be of independent firing. This method is also shown to directly associate neural firing with behavior via their mutual information, which is decomposed into two types of information, conveyed by mean firing rate and coincident firing, respectively. Then, we show that these results, using the 'orthogonal' decompo sition, are naturally extended to the case of three neurons and n neurons in general. 1 Introduction Based on the theory of hierarchic",Optimization & Theoretical ML,ea5a486c712a91e48443cd802642223d-Paper.pdf,2001
Circuits for VLSI Implementation of,Experimental data has shown that synaptic strength modification in some types of biological neurons depends upon precise spike tim ing differences between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. Sev eral temporally-asymmetric Hebbian learning rules motivated by this data have been proposed. We argue that such learning rules are suitable to analog VLSI implementation. We describe an eas ily tunable circuit to modify the weight of a silicon spiking neuron according to those learning rules. Test results from the fabrication of the circuit using a O.6J.lm CMOS process are given. 1 Introduction Hebbian learning rules modify weights of synapses according to correlations between activity at the input and the output of neurons. Most artificial neural networks using Hebbian learning are based on pulse-rate correlations between continuous valued signals; they reduce the neural spike trains to mean firing rates and thus precise timing does not carry information. With this approach the spiking nature,Computer Vision,ef41d488755367316f04fc0e0e9dc9fc-Paper.pdf,2001
Laplacian Eigenmaps and Spectral,"Drawing on the correspondence between the graph Laplacian, the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a manifold, and the connections to the heat equation, we propose a geometrically motivated algorithm for constructing a representation for data sampled from a low di mensional manifold embedded in a higher dimensional space. The algorithm provides a computationally efficient approach to non linear dimensionality reduction that has locality preserving prop erties and a natural connection to clustering. Several applications are considered. In many areas of artificial intelligence, information retrieval and data mining, one is often confronted with intrinsically low dimensional data lying in a very high di mensional space. For example, gray scale n x n images of a fixed object taken with a moving camera yield data points in rn: n2. However, the intrinsic dimensionality of the space of all images of the same object is the number of degrees of freedom of the camera - in fact the space has the natural",Optimization & Theoretical ML,f106b7f99d2cb30c3db1c3cc0fde9ccb-Paper.pdf,2001

Minimax Probability Machine,"When constructing a classifier, the probability of correct classifi cation of future data points should be maximized. In the current paper this desideratum is translated in a very direct way into an optimization problem, which is solved using methods from con vex optimization. We also show how to exploit Mercer kernels in this setting to obtain nonlinear decision boundaries. A worst-case bound on the probability of misclassification of future data is ob tained explicitly. 1 Introduction Consider the problem of choosing a linear discriminant by minimizing the probabil ities that data vectors fall on the wrong side of the boundary. One way to attempt to achieve this is via a generative approach in which one makes distributional as sumptions about the class-conditional densities and thereby estimates and controls the relevant probabilities. The need to make distributional assumptions, however, casts doubt on the generality and validity of such an approach, and in discrimina tive solutions",Optimization & Theoretical ML,f48c04ffab49ff0e5d1176244fdfb65c-Paper.pdf,2001

By examining when (cid:15)-tubes exist, we show that SVR can be regarded as a classi(cid:12)cationproblem inthe dualspace.

BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION VIA,"We consider a problem of blind source separation from a set of instan taneous linear mixtures, where the mixing matrix is unknown. It was discovered recently, that exploiting the sparsity of sources in an appro priate representation according to some signal dictionary, dramatically improves the quality of separation. In this work we use the property of multi scale transforms, such as wavelet or wavelet packets, to decompose signals into sets of local features with various degrees of sparsity. We use this intrinsic property for selecting the best (most sparse) subsets of features for further separation. The performance of the algorithm is ver ified on noise-free and noisy data. Experiments with simulated signals, musical sounds and images demonstrate significant improvement of sep aration quality over previously reported results. 1 Introduction In the blind source separation problem an N-channel sensor signal x(~) is generated by M unknown scalar source signals srn(~), linearly mixed to",Optimization & Theoretical ML,f80bf05527157a8c2a7bb63b22f49aaa-Paper.pdf,2001
Estimating the Reliability of leA,"When applying unsupervised learning techniques like ICA or tem poral decorrelation, a key question is whether the discovered pro jections are reliable. In other words: can we give error bars or can we assess the quality of our separation? We use resampling meth ods to tackle these questions and show experimentally that our proposed variance estimations are strongly correlated to the sepa ration error. We demonstrate that this reliability estimation can be used to choose the appropriate ICA-model, to enhance signifi cantly the separation performance, and, most important, to mark the components that have a actual physical meaning. Application to 49-channel-data from an magneto encephalography (MEG) ex periment underlines the usefulness of our approach. 1 Introduction Blind source separation (BSS) techniques have found wide-spread use in various application domains, e.g. acoustics, telecommunication or biomedical signal pro cessing.

Learning from Infinite Data,"We propose the following general method for scaling learning algorithms to arbitrarily large data sets. Consider the model Mii learned by the algorithm using ni examples in step i (ii = (nl, ... ,nm)), and the model Moo that would be learned using in finite examples. Upper-bound the loss L(Mii' Moo) between them as a function of ii, and then minimize the algorithm's time com plexity f(ii) subject to the constraint that L(Moo, Mii) be at most f with probability at most 8. We apply this method to the EM algorithm for mixtures of Gaussians. Preliminary experiments on a series of large data sets provide evidence of the potential of this approach. 1 An Approach to Large-Scale Learning Large data sets make it possible to reliably learn complex models. On the other hand, they require large computational resources to learn from. While in the past the factor limiting the quality of learnable models was typically the quantity of data available, in many domains today data is super-abundant, and t",Optimization & Theoretical ML,f8bf09f5fceaea80e1f864a1b48938bf-Paper.pdf,2001
Features to Distributions on Images,"We describe the g-factor, which relates probability distributions on image features to distributions on the images themselves. The g-factor depends only on our choice of features and lattice quanti zation and is independent of the training image data. We illustrate the importance of the g-factor by analyzing how the parameters of Markov Random Field (i.e. Gibbs or log-linear) probability models of images are learned from data by maximum likelihood estimation. In particular, we study homogeneous MRF models which learn im age distributions in terms of clique potentials corresponding to fea ture histogram statistics (d. Minimax Entropy Learning (MEL) by Zhu, Wu and Mumford 1997 [11]). We first use our analysis of the g-factor to determine when the clique potentials decouple for different features. Second, we show that clique potentials can be computed analytically by approximating the g-factor. Third, we demonstrate a connection between this approximation and the Generalized Iterative Sca",Computer Vision,f8c0c968632845cd133308b1a494967f-Paper.pdf,2001
Distribution of Mutual Information,"The mutual information of two random variables z and J with joint probabilities {7rij} is commonly used in learning Bayesian nets as well as in many other fields. The chances 7rij are usually estimated by the empirical sampling frequency nij In leading to a point es timate J(nij In) for the mutual information. To answer questions like ""is J (nij In) consistent with zero?"" or ""what is the probability that the true mutual information is much larger than the point es timate?"" one has to go beyond the point estimate. In the Bayesian framework one can answer these questions by utilizing a (second order) prior distribution p( 7r) comprising prior information about 7r. From the prior p(7r) one can compute the posterior p(7rln), from which the distribution p(Iln) of the mutual information can be cal culated. We derive reliable and quickly computable approximations for p(Iln). We concentrate on the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, and non-informative priors.

A Maximum-Likelihood Approach to,"Multisensory response enhancement (MRE) is the augmentation of the response of a neuron to sensory input of one modality by si multaneous input from another modality. The maximum likelihood (ML) model presented here modifies the Bayesian model for MRE (Anastasio et al.) by incorporating a decision strategy to maximize the number of correct decisions. Thus the ML model can also deal with the important tasks of stimulus discrimination and identifi cation in the presence of incongruent visual and auditory cues. It accounts for the inverse effectiveness observed in neurophysiolog ical recording data, and it predicts a functional relation between uni- and bimodal levels of discriminability that is testable both in neurophysiological and behavioral experiments. 1 Introduction In a typical environment stimuli occur at various positions in space and time.

"String Kernels, Fisher Kernels and Finite","In this paper we show how the generation of documents can be thought of as a k-stage Markov process, which leads to a Fisher ker nel from which the n-gram and string kernels can be re-constructed. The Fisher kernel view gives a more flexible insight into the string kernel and suggests how it can be parametrised in a way that re flects the statistics of the training corpus. Furthermore, the prob abilistic modelling approach suggests extending the Markov pro cess to consider sub-sequences of varying length, rather than the standard fixed-length approach used in the string kernel. We give a procedure for determining which sub-sequences are informative features and hence generate a Finite State Machine model, which can again be used to obtain a Fisher kernel. By adjusting the parametrisation we can also influence the weighting received by the features. In this way we are able to obtain a logarithmic weighting in a Fisher kernel.

All healthy human infants, in contrast, learn any of the approximately 6000 human languages rapidly, accurately and spon taneously. Any explanation of how they accomplish this difficult task must specify the (innate) inductive bias that human infants bring to bear, and the input data that is available to them.

Efficient Learning Equilibrium *,"We introduce efficient learning equilibrium (ELE), a normative ap proach to learning in non cooperative settings. In ELE, the learn ing algorithms themselves are required to be in equilibrium. In addition, the learning algorithms arrive at a desired value after polynomial time, and deviations from a prescribed ELE become ir rational after polynomial time. We prove the existence of an ELE in the perfect monitoring setting, where the desired value is the expected payoff in a Nash equilibrium. We also show that an ELE does not always exist in the imperfect monitoring case. Yet, it exists in the special case of common-interest games. Finally, we extend our results to general stochastic games. 1 Introduction Reinforcement learning in the context of multi-agent interaction has attracted the attention of researchers in cognitive psychology, experimental economics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and related fields for quite some time [8, 4].

Approximate Inference and,"Side-chain prediction is an important subtask in the protein-folding problem. We show that finding a minimal energy side-chain con figuration is equivalent to performing inference in an undirected graphical model. The graphical model is relatively sparse yet has many cycles. We used this equivalence to assess the performance of approximate inference algorithms in a real-world setting. Specifi cally we compared belief propagation (BP), generalized BP (GBP) and naive mean field (MF). In cases where exact inference was possible, max-product BP al ways found the global minimum of the energy (except in few cases where it failed to converge), while other approximation algorithms of similar complexity did not. In the full protein data set, max product BP always found a lower energy configuration than the other algorithms, including a widely used protein-folding software (SCWRL). 1 Introduction Inference in graphical models scales exponentially with the number of variables.

On the Dirichlet Prior and Bayesian,"A common objective in learning a model from data is to recover its network structure, while the model parameters are of minor in terest. For example, we may wish to recover regulatory networks from high-throughput data sources. In this paper we examine how Bayesian regularization using a product of independent Dirichlet priors over the model parameters affects the learned model struc ture in a domain with discrete variables. We show that a small scale parameter - often interpreted as ""equivalent sample size"" or ""prior strength"" - leads to a strong regularization of the model structure (sparse graph) given a sufficiently large data set. In par ticular, the empty graph is obtained in the limit of a vanishing scale parameter. This is diametrically opposite to what one may expect in this limit, namely the complete graph from an (unregularized) maximum likelihood estimate. Since the prior affects the parame ters as expected, the scale parameter balances a trade-off between regularizing the ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,1819932ff5cf474f4f19e7c7024640c2-Paper.pdf,2002
Scaling of Probability-Based Optimization,"Population-based Incremental Learning is shown require very sen sitive scaling of its learning rate. The learning rate must scale with the system size in a problem-dependent way. This is shown in two problems: the needle-in-a haystack, in which the learning rate must vanish exponentially in the system size, and in a smooth function in which the learning rate must vanish like the square root of the system size. Two methods are proposed for removing this sensitiv ity. A learning dynamics which obeys detailed balance is shown to give consistent performance over the entire range of learning rates. An analog of mutation is shown to require a learning rate which scales as the inverse system size, but is problem independent. 1 Introduction There has been much recent work using probability models to search in optimization problems.

Optimality of Reinforcement Learning,"There are several reinforcement learning algorithms that yield ap proximate solutions for the problem of policy evaluation when the value function is represented with a linear function approximator.

Binary Coding in Auditory Cortex,"Cortical neurons have been reported to use both rate and temporal codes. Here we describe a novel mode in which each neuron generates exactly 0 or 1 action potentials, but not more, in response to a stimulus. We used cell-attached recording, which ensured single-unit isolation, to record responses in rat auditory cortex to brief tone pips. Surprisingly, the majority of neurons exhibited binary behavior with few multi-spike responses; several dramatic examples consisted of exactly one spike on 100% of trials, with no trial-to-trial variability in spike count. Many neurons were tuned to stimulus frequency. Since individual trials yielded at most one spike for most neurons, the information about stimulus frequency was encoded in the population, and would not have been accessible to later stages of processing that only had access to the activity of a single unit. These binary units allow a more efficient population code than is possible with conventional rate coding units, and are consiste",Computer Vision,2321994d85d661d792223f647000c65f-Paper.pdf,2002

Dopamine Induced Bistability Enhances,"Single unit activity in the striatum of awake monkeys shows a marked dependence on the expected reward that a behavior will elicit. We present a computational model of spiny neurons, the principal neurons of the striatum, to assess the hypothesis that di rect neuromodulatory effects of dopamine through the activation of D 1 receptors mediate the reward dependency of spiny neuron activity. Dopamine release results in the amplification of key ion currents, leading to the emergence of bistability, which not only modulates the peak firing rate but also introduces a temporal and state dependence of the model's response, thus improving the de tectability of temporally correlated inputs. 1 Introduction The classic notion of the basal ganglia as being involved in purely motor processing has expanded over the years to include sensory and cognitive functions. A sur prising new finding is that much of this activity shows a motivational component.

Topographic Map Formation by Silicon,"We describe a self-configuring neuromorphic chip that uses a model of activity-dependent axon remodeling to automatically wire topographic maps based solely on input correlations.

Virtual axons move by rerouting address-events.

An Impossibility Theorem for Clustering,"Although the study of clustering is centered around an intuitively compelling goal, it has been very di(cid:14)cult to develop a uni(cid:12)ed framework for reasoning about it at a technical level, and pro- foundly diverse approaches to clustering abound in the research community.

Ranking with Large Margin Principle: Two,"We discuss the problem of ranking k instances with the use of a ""large margin"" principle. We introduce two main approaches: the first is the ""fixed margin"" policy in which the margin of the closest neighboring classes is being maximized - which turns out to be a direct generaliza tion of SVM to ranking learning. The second approach allows for k - 1 different margins where the sum of margins is maximized. This approach is shown to reduce to lI-SVM when the number of classes k = 2. Both approaches are optimal in size of 21 where I is the total number of training examples. Experiments performed on visual classification and ""collab orative filtering"" show that both approaches outperform existing ordinal regression algorithms applied for ranking and multi-class SVM applied to general multi-class classification. 1 Introduction In this paper we investigate the problem of inductive learning from the point of view of predicting variables of ordinal scale [3, 7,5], a setting referred to as ranki",Optimization & Theoretical ML,51de85ddd068f0bc787691d356176df9-Paper.pdf,2002

Learning with Multiple Labels,"In this paper, we study a special kind of learning problem in which each training instance is given a set of (or distribution over) candidate class labels and only one of the candidate labels is the correct one. Such a problem can occur, e.g., in an information retrieval setting where a set of words is associated with an image, or if classes labels are organized hierarchically. We propose a novel discriminative approach for handling the ambiguity of class labels in the training examples. The experiments with the proposed approach over five different UCI datasets show that our approach is able to find the correct label among the set of candidate labels and actually achieve performance close to the case when each training instance is given a single correct label. In contrast, naIve methods degrade rapidly as more ambiguity is introduced into the labels. 1 Introduction Supervised and unsupervised learning problems have been extensively studied in the machine learning literature.

Fast Kernels for String and Tree Matching,"In this paper we present a new algorithm suitable for matching discrete objects such as strings and trees in linear time, thus obviating dynarrtic programming with quadratic time complexity. Furthermore, prediction cost in many cases can be reduced to linear cost in the length of the se quence to be classified, regardless of the number of support vectors. This improvement on the currently available algorithms makes string kernels a viable alternative for the practitioner. 1 Introduction Many problems in machine learning require the classifier to work with a set of discrete ex amples. Common examples include biological sequence analysis where data is represented as strings [4] and Natural Language Processing (NLP) where the data is in the form a parse tree [3]. In order to apply kernel methods one defines a measure of similarity between discrete structures via a feature map Â¢ : X ----+ Jek. Here X is the set of discrete structures (eg. the set of all parse trees of a language) and JeK i",NLP,743394beff4b1282ba735e5e3723ed74-Paper.pdf,2002

Learning Semantic Similarity,"The standard representation of text documents as bags of words suffers from well known limitations, mostly due to its inability to exploit semantic similarity between terms. Attempts to incorpo rate some notion of term similarity include latent semantic index ing [8], the use of semantic networks [9], and probabilistic methods [5]. In this paper we propose two methods for inferring such sim ilarity from a corpus. The first one defines word-similarity based on document-similarity and viceversa, giving rise to a system of equations whose equilibrium point we use to obtain a semantic similarity measure. The second method models semantic relations by means of a diffusion process on a graph defined by lexicon and co-occurrence information. Both approaches produce valid kernel functions parametrised by a real number. The paper shows how the alignment measure can be used to successfully perform model selection over this parameter. Combined with the use of support vector machines we obtain pos",NLP,778609db5dc7e1a8315717a9cdd8fd6f-Paper.pdf,2002

Dynamical Constraints on Computing,"If the cortex uses spike timing to compute, the timing of the spikes must be robust to perturbations. Based on a recent framework that provides a simple criterion to determine whether a spike sequence produced by a generic network is sensitive to initial conditions, and numerical simulations of a variety of network architectures, we argue within the limits set by our model of the neuron, that it is unlikely that precise sequences of spike timings are used for computation under conditions typically found in the cortex. 1 Introduction Several models of neural computation use the precise timing of spikes to encode information. For example, Abeles et al. have proposed synchronous volleys of spikes (synfire chains) as a candidate for representing information in the cortex [1]. More recently, Maass has demonstrated how spike timing in general, not merely synfire chains, can be utilized to perform nonlinear computations [6]. For any of these schemes to function, the timing of the spikes must ",Optimization & Theoretical ML,806fec5af7f5b48b8a31a003e171f3fb-Paper.pdf,2002

Bayesian Image Super-Resolution,"The extraction of a single high-quality image from a set of low resolution images is an important problem which arises in fields such as remote sensing, surveillance, medical imaging and the ex traction of still images from video. Typical approaches are based on the use of cross-correlation to register the images followed by the inversion of the transformation from the unknown high reso lution image to the observed low resolution images, using regular ization to resolve the ill-posed nature of the inversion process. In this paper we develop a Bayesian treatment of the super-resolution problem in which the likelihood function for the image registra tion parameters is based on a marginalization over the unknown high-resolution image. This approach allows us to estimate the unknown point spread function, and is rendered tractable through the introduction of a Gaussian process prior over images. Results indicate a significant improvement over techniques based on MAP (maximum a-posteriori) ",Computer Vision,88bfcf02e7f554f9e9ea350b699bc6a7-Paper.pdf,2002
